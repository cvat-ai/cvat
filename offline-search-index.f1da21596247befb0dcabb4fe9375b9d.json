Create Organization. Switch to the Organization that you’ve created and subscribe to the Team plan. Invite members to Organization and assign User roles to invited members. Create Project. (Optional) Attach Cloud storages to the Project. Create Task or Multitask. At this step the CVAT platform will automatically create jobs. (Optional) Create Ground truth job. This step can be skipped if you’re employing a manual QA approach. (Optional) Add Instructions for annotators. (Optional) Configure Webhooks. Assign jobs to annotators by adding the annotator name to Assignee and changing the Job stage to Annotation. Annotator will see assigned jobs and annotate them. (Optional) In case you’ve created a Ground truth job give the CVAT platform some time to accumulate the data and check the accuracy of the annotation. If you are using the manual validation, assign jobs to validators by adding the validator name to Assignee and changing the Job stage to Validation. Validator will see assigned jobs and report issues. Note, that validators can correct issues, see Manual QA and Review Check issues and if there is a need for additional improvement, reassign jobs to either the Validator or Annotator.

If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using Minikube. How to setup Minikube. Installed kubectl Installed Helm. Installed dependencies Installing dependencies To install and/or update run:\nhelm dependency update Optional steps Ingress configuration for the Traefik ingress controller is enabled by default.\nNote for Minikube use:\nbecause the Traefik creates its main service with Loadbalanser type, which involve the assignment of externalIP by Cloud, what never happens on Minikube, you need to explicitly set the externalIP address for the traefic service. Add the following to values.override.yaml file: traefik: service: externalIPs: - \"your minikube IP (can be obtained with `minikube ip` command)\" Also ensure that your CVAT ingress appears on your hosts file (/etc/hosts). You can do this by running this command: cvat.local is default domainname, you can override it via values.override.yaml. echo \"$(minikube ip) cvat.local\" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts Configuration Create a values.override.yaml file in the directory with the CVAT Helm chart (for example helm-chart/values.override.yaml if you use the chart from the CVAT repository, or \u003cchart-directory\u003e/values.override.yaml if you pulled the chart from Docker Hub). Fill values.override.yaml with parameters you want to override. Override postgresql password. Postgresql password? Put below into your values.override.yaml\npostgresql: secret: password: \u003cinsert_password\u003e postgres_password: \u003cinsert_postgres_password\u003e replication_password: \u003cinsert_replication_password\u003e Or create your own secret and use it with:\npostgresql: global: postgresql: existingSecret: \u003csecret\u003e (Optional) Enable Auto annotation feature Before starting, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:\nThe Nuclio CLI (nuctl) is installed. To install the CLI, simply download the appropriate CLI version to your installation machine. Set nuclio.enabled: true in your values.override.yaml\nRun helm dependency update in helm-chart directory\nBecause Nuclio functions are images that need to be pushed and pulled to/from the registry, you need to configure credentials to pull from your preferable registry with the following settings: Options:\nvalues.override.yaml file:\nregistry: loginUrl: someurl credentials: username: someuser password: somepass Or you can create a secret with credentials as described in the guide and set registry.secretName=your-registry-credentials-secret-name in the values.override.yaml file.\nIn the case of using Minikube, you can run a local unsecured registry with minikube add-ons:\nminikube addons enable registry minikube addons enable registry-aliases Before Docker container images can be pushed to your newly created insecure registry, you might have to add its address ($(minikube ip):5000) to the list of insecure registries to instruct Docker to accept working against it:\nGet minikube IP address MINIKUBE_IP=$(minikube ip) echo \"Minikube registry address: $MINIKUBE_IP:5000\" Create a Docker daemon config file: vim /etc/docker/daemon.json Add this string to this file: { \"insecure-registries\" : [ \"minikube_registry_address:5000\" ] } Restart Docker: sudo systemctl restart docker Or you can run registry locally as docker container:\nfollow the instructions in the Docker documentation\nPlease note that on MacOS default registry port of 5000 is in use by ControlCenter application. In this case you can just expose registry using different port (for example 5001) in that case you should run registry container with this command\ndocker run -d -p 5001:5000 --name registry registry:2 In that case please change registry port from :5000 to :5001 in subsequent commands (ex. –registry localhost:5001)\nYou might also need to log into your registry account (docker login) on the installation machine before running the deployment command.\nCreate cvat project:\nnuctl --namespace \u003cyour cvat namespace\u003e create project cvat Finally deploy the function, i.e.:\nusing minikube registry: nuctl deploy --project-name cvat --path serverless/tensorflow/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco/nuclio --registry $(minikube ip):5000 --run-registry registry.minikube using Docker hub: nuctl deploy --project-name cvat --path serverless/tensorflow/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco/nuclio --registry docker.io/your_username using local Docker registry: nuctl deploy --project-name cvat --path serverless/tensorflow/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco/nuclio --registry localhost:5000 Analytics Analytics is enabled by default, to disable set analytics.enabled: false in your values.override.yaml\nDeployment Make sure you are using correct kubernetes context. You can check it with kubectl config current-context.\nWarning The k8s service name of Open Policy Agent is fixed to opa by default. This is done to be compatible with CVAT 2.0 but limits this helm chart to a single release per namespace. The OPA url currently can´t be set as an environment variable. As soon as this is possible you can set cvat.opa.composeCompatibleServiceName to false in your value.override.yaml and configure the opa url as additional env. There are two ways to get and install the CVAT Helm chart:\nOption 1: Install from the CVAT repository Execute the following command from the repository root directory.\n1a. With overrides helm upgrade -n \u003cdesired_namespace\u003e \u003crelease_name\u003e -i --create-namespace ./helm-chart -f ./helm-chart/values.yaml -f ./helm-chart/values.override.yaml 1b. Without overrides helm upgrade -n \u003cdesired_namespace\u003e \u003crelease_name\u003e -i --create-namespace ./helm-chart -f ./helm-chart/values.yaml Option 2: Install from Docker Hub (OCI Helm chart) CVAT Helm charts are also published as OCI artifacts to Docker Hub. You can find available versions on the image tags page:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/cvat/cvat/tags\nReplace \u003cchart_version\u003e with the version you want to install.\n2a. Install directly from the registry If you already have your override file (for example, values.override.yaml in the current directory):\nhelm install \u003crelease_name\u003e oci://registry-1.docker.io/cvat/cvat --version \u003cchart_version\u003e -n \u003cdesired_namespace\u003e --create-namespace -f values.override.yaml If you don’t use an override file, you can omit -f values.override.yaml.\n2b. Pull the chart and install from local directory If you want to inspect or customize the chart first:\nhelm pull oci://registry-1.docker.io/cvat/cvat --version \u003cchart_version\u003e tar -xzf cvat-\u003cchart_version\u003e.tgz cd cvat Now you can review values.yaml, create a values.override.yaml file in this directory, and install:\nhelm install \u003crelease_name\u003e \\ . \\ -n \u003cdesired_namespace\u003e \\ --create-namespace \\ -f values.yaml \\ -f values.override.yaml Upgrading an existing release from Docker Hub helm upgrade \u003crelease_name\u003e \\ oci://registry-1.docker.io/cvat/cvat \\ --version \u003cchart_version\u003e \\ -n \u003cdesired_namespace\u003e \\ -f values.override.yaml Post-deployment configuration Create super user How to create superuser?

The both formats have a common part which is described below. From the previous version flipped tag was added. Also original_size tag was added for interpolation mode to specify frame size. In annotation mode each image tag has width and height attributes for the same purpose.\nFor what is rle, see Run-length encoding\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e \u003cannotations\u003e \u003cversion\u003e1.1\u003c/version\u003e \u003cmeta\u003e \u003ctask\u003e \u003cid\u003eNumber: id of the task\u003c/id\u003e \u003cname\u003eString: some task name\u003c/name\u003e \u003csize\u003eNumber: count of frames/images in the task\u003c/size\u003e \u003cmode\u003eString: interpolation or annotation\u003c/mode\u003e \u003coverlap\u003eNumber: number of overlapped frames between segments\u003c/overlap\u003e \u003cbugtracker\u003eString: URL on an page which describe the task\u003c/bugtracker\u003e \u003cflipped\u003eBoolean: were images of the task flipped?

On each image it is possible to have many different objects. Each object can have multiple attributes. If an annotation task is created with z_order flag then each object will have z_order attribute which is used to draw objects properly when they are intersected (if z_order is bigger the object is closer to camera). In previous versions of the format only box shape was available. In later releases mask, polygon, polyline, points, skeletons and tags were added.

Attribute annotation mode – focus on editing object attributes, such as color, size, etc. without changing shapes. Single shape mode – create one shape and automatically exit drawing. Tag annotation mode – add frame-level tags without drawing shapes. Review mode – review and validate existing annotations. Creating shapes When drawing objects on frames, you can choose how shapes behave over time:\nShape – creates a single shape on the current frame.\nTrack – creates a sequence of shapes linked as the same object across multiple frames.\nCVAT also supports different drawing methods, such as defining shapes by two opposite points or by placing four corner points for extra control.\nShape tools Shapes represent the geometry used to annotate objects. CVAT supports multiple shape types for different tasks:\nShape Use case Rectangles Best for simple object detection where objects have a box-like shape, such as detecting windows in a building. Polygons Suited for complex shapes in images, like outlining geographical features in maps or detailed product shapes. Polylines Great for annotating linear objects like roads, pathways, or limbs in pose estimation. Ellipses A tool for creating segmentation masks for circular or oval objects like plates, balls, or eyes. Cuboids A tool for creating 3D segmentation masks that capture object volume and position, useful for autonomous driving or robotics. Skeletons A tool for creating segmentation masks of articulated structures, ideal for human pose estimation, animation, and movement analysis. Brush Tool A tool for creating detailed, free-form segmentation masks where pixel-level precision is required, such as in medical imaging. Tags Useful for image and video classification tasks, like identifying scenes or themes in a dataset. Automated annotation CVAT provides a set of AI-powered tools that speed up annotation by automatically detecting, segmenting, or tracking objects on images and videos. These tools work with built-in models (such as SAM/SAM2), pre-trained models from native integrations like Hugging Face and Roboflow, as well as custom or third-party models you deploy through CVAT AI Agents (including YOLO and other frameworks).\nBelow is a detailed table of the supported models and the platforms they operate on:\nAlgorithm Name Category Framework CPU Support GPU Support Segment Anything Interactor PyTorch ✔️ ✔️ Deep Extreme Cut Interactor OpenVINO ✔️ Faster RCNN Detector OpenVINO ✔️ Mask RCNN Detector OpenVINO ✔️ YOLO v3 Detector OpenVINO ✔️ YOLO v7 Detector ONNX ✔️ ✔️ Object Reidentification ReID OpenVINO ✔️ Semantic Segmentation for ADAS Detector OpenVINO ✔️ Text Detection v4 Detector OpenVINO ✔️ SiamMask Tracker PyTorch ✔️ ✔️ TransT Tracker PyTorch ✔️ ✔️ Inside-Outside Guidance Interactor PyTorch ✔️ Faster RCNN Detector TensorFlow ✔️ ✔️ RetinaNet Detector PyTorch ✔️ ✔️ Face Detection Detector OpenVINO ✔️ Useful links Name Description Self-hosted Installation Guide Start here to install self-hosted solution on your premises.

Please refer to the Annotation section for more details.\nAdvanced Topics How to get CVAT source code Git (Linux, Mac, Windows) Install Git on your system if it’s not already installed\nUbuntu: sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install -y git Windows: Follow instructions from https://git-scm.com/download/win Clone CVAT source code from the GitHub repository.\nThe command below will clone the default branch (develop):\ngit clone https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat cd cvat To clone specific tag, e.g. v2.1.0:\ngit clone -b v2.1.0 https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat cd cvat Wget (Linux, Mac) To download latest develop branch:\nwget https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/archive/refs/heads/develop.zip unzip develop.zip \u0026\u0026 mv cvat-develop cvat cd cvat To download specific tag:\nwget https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/archive/refs/tags/v1.7.0.zip unzip v1.7.0.zip \u0026\u0026 mv cvat-1.7.0 cvat cd cvat Curl (Linux, Mac) To download the latest develop branch:\ncurl -LO https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/archive/refs/heads/develop.zip unzip develop.zip \u0026\u0026 mv cvat-develop cvat cd cvat To download specific tag:\ncurl -LO https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/archive/refs/tags/v1.7.0.zip unzip v1.7.0.zip \u0026\u0026 mv cvat-1.7.0 cvat cd cvat CVAT healthcheck command The following command allows testing the CVAT container to make sure it works.\ndocker exec -t cvat_server python manage.py health_check The expected output of a healthy CVAT container:\nCache backend: default ... working DatabaseBackend ... working DiskUsage ... working MemoryUsage ... working MigrationsHealthCheck ... working OPAHealthCheck ... working Configuring Disk Usage Health Check\nCVAT_HEALTH_DISK_USAGE_MAX: This environment variable specifies the maximum allowed disk usage percentage for the volume where CVAT is installed. If the disk usage exceeds this threshold, the DiskUsage health check will fail. The value should be an integer representing a percentage (e.g., 90 for 90%). Read more about how to enable health checks. Deploying CVAT behind a proxy If you deploy CVAT behind a proxy and do not plan to use any of serverless functions for automatic annotation, the exported environment variables http_proxy, https_proxy and no_proxy should be enough to build images. Otherwise please create or edit the file ~/.docker/config.json in the home directory of the user which starts containers and add JSON such as the following:\n{ \"proxies\": { \"default\": { \"httpProxy\": \"http://proxy_server:port\", \"httpsProxy\": \"http://proxy_server:port\", \"noProxy\": \"*.test.example.com,.example2.com\" } } } These environment variables are set automatically within any container. Please see the Docker documentation for more details.\nUsing the Traefik dashboard If you are customizing the docker compose files and you come upon some unexpected issues, using the Traefik dashboard might be very useful to see if the problem is with Traefik configuration, or with some of the services.\nYou can enable the Traefik dashboard by uncommenting the following lines from docker-compose.yml\nservices: traefik: # Uncomment to get Traefik dashboard # - \"--entryPoints.dashboard.address=:8090\" # - \"--api.dashboard=true\" # labels: # - traefik.enable=true # - traefik.http.routers.dashboard.entrypoints=dashboard # - traefik.http.routers.dashboard.service=api@internal # - traefik.http.routers.dashboard.rule=Host(`${CVAT_HOST:-localhost}`) and if you are using docker-compose.https.yml, also uncomment these lines\nservices: traefik: command: # Uncomment to get Traefik dashboard # - \"--entryPoints.dashboard.address=:8090\" # - \"--api.dashboard=true\" Note that this “insecure” dashboard is not recommended in production (and if your instance is publicly available); if you want to keep the dashboard in production you should read Traefik’s documentation on how to properly secure it.\nAdditional components Semi-automatic and automatic annotation Please follow this guide.\nStop all containers The command below stops and removes containers and networks created by up.\ndocker compose down Use your own domain If you want to access your instance of CVAT outside of your localhost (on another domain), you should specify the CVAT_HOST environment variable, like this:\nexport CVAT_HOST=\u003cYOUR_DOMAIN\u003e Share path You can use shared storage for uploading data when you create a task. To do that, you need to mount the shared storage to the CVAT docker container. Example of docker-compose.override.yml for this purpose:\nservices: cvat_server: volumes: - cvat_share:/home/django/share:ro cvat_worker_import: volumes: - cvat_share:/home/django/share:ro cvat_worker_export: volumes: - cvat_share:/home/django/share:ro cvat_worker_annotation: volumes: - cvat_share:/home/django/share:ro cvat_worker_chunks: volumes: - cvat_share:/home/django/share:ro volumes: cvat_share: driver_opts: type: none device: /mnt/share o: bind You can change the share device path to your actual share.\nYou can mount your cloud storage as a FUSE and use it later as a share.\nEmail verification You can enable email verification for newly registered users. Specify these options in the settings file to configure Django allauth to enable email verification (ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = ‘mandatory’). Access is denied until the user’s email address is verified.\nACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD = 'username_email' ACCOUNT_CONFIRM_EMAIL_ON_GET = True ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED = True ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = 'mandatory' # Email backend settings for Django EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend' Also, you need to configure the Django email backend to send emails. This depends on the email server you are using and is not covered in this tutorial, please see Django SMTP backend configuration for details.\nDeploy CVAT on the Scaleway public cloud Please follow this tutorial to install and set up remote access to CVAT on a Scaleway cloud instance with data in a mounted object storage bucket.\nDeploy secure CVAT instance with HTTPS Using Traefik, you can automatically obtain a TLS certificate for your domain from Let’s Encrypt, enabling you to use HTTPS protocol to access your website.\nTo enable this, first set the CVAT_HOST (the domain of your website) and ACME_EMAIL (contact email for Let’s Encrypt) environment variables:\nexport CVAT_HOST=\u003cYOUR_DOMAIN\u003e export ACME_EMAIL=\u003cYOUR_EMAIL\u003e Then, use the docker-compose.https.yml file to override the base docker-compose.yml file:\ndocker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.https.yml up -d Note In the firewall, ports 80 and 443 must be open for inbound connections from any Then, the CVAT instance will be available at your domain on ports 443 (HTTPS) and 80 (HTTP, redirects to 443).\nDeploy CVAT with an external database By default, docker compose up will start a PostgreSQL database server, which will be used to store CVAT’s data. If you’d like to use your own PostgreSQL instance instead, you can do so as follows. Note that CVAT only supports the same major version of PostgreSQL as is used in docker-compose.yml.\nFirst, define environment variables with database connection settings:\nexport CVAT_POSTGRES_HOST=\u003cPostgreSQL hostname\u003e # mandatory export CVAT_POSTGRES_PORT=\u003cPostgreSQL port\u003e # defaults to 5432 export CVAT_POSTGRES_DBNAME=\u003cPostgreSQL database name\u003e # defaults to \"cvat\" export CVAT_POSTGRES_USER=\u003cPostgreSQL role name\u003e # defaults to \"root\" export CVAT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\u003cPostgreSQL role password\u003e # mandatory Then, add the docker-compose.external_db.yml file to your docker compose up command:\ndocker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.external_db.yml up -d How to pull/build/update CVAT images For a CVAT version lower or equal to 2.1.0, you need to pull images using docker because the compose configuration always points to the latest image tag, e.g.\ndocker pull cvat/server:v1.7.0 docker tag cvat/server:v1.7.0 openvino/cvat_server:latest docker pull cvat/ui:v1.7.0 docker tag cvat/ui:v1.7.0 openvino/cvat_ui:latest For CVAT version more than v2.1.0 it’s possible to pull specific version of prebuilt images from DockerHub using CVAT_VERSION environment variable to specify the version (e.g. dev):\nCVAT_VERSION=dev docker compose pull To build images yourself include docker-compose.dev.yml compose config file to docker compose command. This can be useful if you want to build a CVAT with some source code changes.\ndocker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml build To update local images to latest or dev tags run:\nCVAT_VERSION=dev docker compose pull or\nCVAT_VERSION=latest docker compose pull Troubleshooting Sources for users from China If you stay in China, for installation you need to override the following sources.\nFor use apt update using:\nUbuntu mirroring help\nPre-compiled packages:\ndeb https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu/ focal main restricted universe multiverse deb https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu/ focal-updates main restricted universe multiverse deb https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu/ focal-backports main restricted universe multiverse deb https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu/ focal-security main restricted universe multiverse Or source packages:\ndeb-src https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu/ focal main restricted universe multiverse deb-src https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu/ focal-updates main restricted universe multiverse deb-src https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu/ focal-backports main restricted universe multiverse deb-src https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu/ focal-security main restricted universe multiverse Docker mirror station\nAdd registry mirrors into daemon.json file:\n{ \"registry-mirrors\": [ \"http://f1361db2.m.daocloud.io\", \"https://docker.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn\", \"https://hub-mirror.c.163.com\", \"https://mirror.ccs.tencentyun.com\" ] } For using pip:\nPyPI mirroring help\npip config set global.index-url https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple For using npm:\nnpm mirroring help\nnpm config set registry https://registry.npm.taobao.org/ Instead of git using gitee:\nCVAT repository on gitee.com\nFor replace acceleration source docker.com run:\ncurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add - sudo add-apt-repository \\ \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\ $(lsb_release -cs) \\ For replace acceleration source google.com run:\ncurl https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add - HTTPS is not working because of a certificate If you’re having trouble with an SSL connection, to find the cause, you’ll need to get the logs from traefik by running:\ndocker logs traefik The logs will help you find out the problem.\nIf the error is related to a firewall, then:\nOpen ports 80 and 443 for inbound connections from any.

Your task (or project) has the label vehicle. To annotate, you need to match these two labels to give CVAT a hint that, in this case, car = vehicle.\nIf you have a label that is not on the list of DL labels, you will not be able to match them.\nFor this reason, supported DL models are suitable only for certain labels.\nTo check the list of labels for each model, see Models papers and official documentation.\nModels Automatic annotation uses pre-installed and added models.\nNote For self-hosted solutions, you need to install Automatic Annotation first and add models. List of pre-installed models:\nModel Description Attributed face detection Three OpenVINO models work together: Face Detection 0205: face detector based on MobileNetV2 as a backbone with a FCOS head for indoor and outdoor scenes shot by a front-facing camera. Emotions recognition retail 0003: fully convolutional network for recognition of five emotions (‘neutral’, ‘happy’, ‘sad’, ‘surprise’, ‘anger’). Age gender recognition retail 0013: fully convolutional network for simultaneous Age/Gender recognition. The network can recognize the age of people in the [18 - 75] years old range; it is not applicable for children since their faces were not in the training set. RetinaNet R101 RetinaNet is a one-stage object detection model that utilizes a focal loss function to address class imbalance during training. Focal loss applies a modulating term to the cross entropy loss to focus learning on hard negative examples. RetinaNet is a single, unified network composed of a backbone network and two task-specific subnetworks.

Each client application - be it a command line tool, browser or a script - all interact with CVAT via HTTP requests and responses:\nAPI schema You can obtain schema for your server at \u003cyourserver\u003e/api/docs. For example, the official CVAT.ai application has API documentation here.\nExamples Here you can see how a task is created in CVAT:\nAt first, we have to login Then we create a task from its configuration Then we send task data (images, videos etc.) We wait for data processing and finish Design principles Common pattern for our REST API is \u003cVERB\u003e [namespace] \u003cobjects\u003e \u003cid\u003e \u003caction\u003e.\nVERB can be POST, GET, PATCH, PUT, DELETE. namespace should scope some specific functionality like auth, lambda. It is optional in the scheme. Typical objects are tasks, projects, jobs. When you want to extract a specific object from a collection, just specify its id. An action can be used to simplify REST API or provide an endpoint for entities without objects endpoint like annotations, data, data/meta. Note: action should not duplicate other endpoints without a reason. When you’re developing new endpoints, follow these guidelines:\nUse nouns instead of verbs in endpoint paths. For example, POST /api/tasks instead of POST /api/tasks/create. Accept and respond with JSON whenever it is possible Name collections with plural nouns (e.g. /tasks, /projects) Try to keep the API structure flat. Prefer two separate endpoints for /projects and /tasks instead of /projects/:id1/tasks/:id2. Use filters to extract necessary information like /tasks/:id2?project=:id1. In some cases it is useful to get all tasks. If the structure is hierarchical, it cannot be done easily. Also you have to know both :id1 and :id2 to get information about the task. Note: for now we accept GET /tasks/:id2/jobs but it should be replaced by /jobs?task=:id2 in the future. Handle errors gracefully and return standard error codes (e.g. 201, 400) Allow filtering, sorting, and pagination Maintain good security practices Cache data to improve performance Versioning our APIs. It should be done when you delete an endpoint or modify its behaviors. Versioning uses a schema with Accept header with vendor media type. Playground Sometimes, it may be necessary to send customized requests or simply test some endpoints available on the server. It’s possible to send custom requests to a CVAT server directly from your web browser without special extensions. This can be done at the Swagger page provided by the server. The page is available at \u003ccvat_host\u003e/api/swagger (e.g. https://app.cvat.ai/api/swagger). The Swagger page provides the autogenerated documentation, supports multiple authentication options and allows sending custom requests to various server endpoints.\nSwagger documentation is visible on allowed hosts. If necessary, the list can be modified by updating the environment variable in docker-compose.ymlfile with cvat hosted machine IP or domain name. Example - ALLOWED_HOSTS: 'localhost, 127.0.0.1'.\nMake a request to a resource stored on a server and the server will respond with the requested information.\nThe endpoints are grouped by APIs:\nauth - user authentication queries comments - requests to post/delete comments to issues issues - update, delete and view problem comments jobs -requests to manage the job lambda - requests to work with lambda function projects - project management queries reviews -adding and removing the review of the job server - server information requests tasks - requests to manage tasks users - user management queries etc. In the Models section below you can also find various data structures used in the endpoints.\nEach group contains queries related to a different types of HTTP methods such as: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, etc. Different methods are highlighted in different color.

SAM2 tracking is available in two implementations:\nNuclio SAM2 Tracker: Available only for Enterprise deployments. This is implemented as a serverless function deployed via Nuclio framework.\nAI Agent SAM2 Tracker: Available for CVAT Online and Enterprise via auto-annotation (AA) functions that run on user-side agents. This brings SAM2 tracking capabilities to CVAT Online users who previously couldn’t access this feature.\nIt is strongly recommended to deploy the model using a GPU. Although it is possible to use a CPU-based version, it generally performs much slower and is suitable only for handling a single parallel request. The AI agent variant runs on user hardware, providing flexibility for GPU usage without server configuration requirements.\nUnlike a regular tracking model, both SAM2 tracker implementations are designed to be applied to existing objects (polygons and masks) to track them forward for a specified number of frames.\nHow to install Choose the installation method based on your platform and deployment needs.\nNote Nuclio SAM2 Tracker is only available in the Enterprise version. The AI agent variant brings SAM2 tracking to CVAT Online and Enterprise. Note Both tracker implementations require the enhanced actions UI plugin, which is enabled by default. Usually, no additional steps are necessary on this. Nuclio SAM2 Tracker (CVAT Enterprise) Docker You can use existing scripts from the community repository (./serverless/deploy_cpu.sh or ./serverless/deploy_gpu.sh). To deploy the feature, simply run:\n./serverless/deploy_gpu.sh \"path/to/the/function\" Kubernetes You need to deploy the Nuclio function manually. Note that this function requires a Redis storage configured to keep the tracking state. You may use the same storage as cvat_redis_ondisk uses. When running the nuclio deploy command, make sure to provide the necessary arguments. The minimal command is: nuctl deploy \"path/to/the/function\" --env CVAT_FUNCTIONS_REDIS_HOST=\"\u003credis_host\u003e\" --env CVAT_FUNCTIONS_REDIS_PORT=\"\u003credis_port\u003e\" --env CVAT_FUNCTIONS_REDIS_PASSWORD=\"\u003credis_password\u003e\" # if applicable AI Agent SAM2 Tracker (CVAT Online + Enterprise) The AI agent implementation enables SAM2 tracking for CVAT Online users and provides an alternative deployment method for Enterprise customers. This approach runs the tracking model on user hardware via auto-annotation (AA) functions.\nPrerequisites Python 3.10 or later Git CVAT Online account or Enterprise instance Optional: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support for faster inference Setup Instructions Clone the CVAT repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat.git \u003cCVAT_DIR\u003e Install required dependencies:\npip install cvat-cli -r \u003cCVAT_DIR\u003e/ai-models/tracker/sam2/requirements.txt Note If you encounter issues installing SAM2, refer to the SAM2 installation guide for solutions to common problems.

If the agent stops, active tracking operations will fail and need to be restarted. Version Requirements AI Agent SAM2 Tracker: Requires CVAT version 2.42.0 or later Classic SAM2 Tracker: Available in all Enterprise versions Python: Version 3.10 or later for AI agent setup GPU Support: Optional but recommended for both implementations Usage Both SAM2 tracker implementations provide similar user experiences with slight differences in the UI labels.\nRunning the Nuclio SAM2 Tracker The nuclio tracker can be applied to any polygons and masks. To run the tracker on an object, open the object menu and click Run annotation action.\nAlternatively, you can use a hotkey: select the object and press Ctrl + E (default shortcut). When the modal opened, in “Select action” list, choose Segment Anything 2: Tracker:\nRunning the AI Agent SAM2 Tracker Once you have registered the SAM2 AI agent and it’s running, you’ll see “AI Tracker: SAM2” as an available action in the annotation UI for video shape tracking.\nTo use the AI agent tracker:\nCreate or open a CVAT task from a video file or video-like sequence of images (all images must have the same dimensions) Open one of the jobs from the task Draw a mask or polygon around an object Right-click the object and choose “Run annotation action” Select “AI Tracker: SAM2” from the action list Specify the target frame and click Run The usage flow parallels the existing annotation action interface but utilizes the remote AI agent rather than built-in serverless functions.\nTracking Process Specify the target frame until which you want the object to be tracked, then click the Run button to start tracking. The process begins and may take some time to complete. The duration depends on the inference device, and the number of frames where the object will be tracked.\nOnce the process is complete, the modal window closes. You can review how the object was tracked. If you notice that the tracked shape deteriorates at some point, you can adjust the object coordinates and run the tracker again from that frame.\nRunning on multiple objects Instead of tracking each object individually, you can track multiple objects simultaneously. To do this, click the Menu button in the annotation view and select the Run Actions option:\nAlternatively, you can use a hotkey: just press Ctrl + E (default shortcut) when there are no objects selected. This opens the actions modal. In this case, the tracker will be applied to all visible objects of suitable types (polygons and masks). In the action list of the opened modal, select either:\nSegment Anything 2: Tracker (for the nuclio implementation) AI Tracker: SAM2 (for the AI agent implementation) Specify the target frame until which you want the objects to be tracked, then click the Run button to start tracking. The process begins and may take some time to complete. The duration depends on the inference device, the number of simultaneously tracked objects, and the number of frames where the objects will be tracked.\nOnce the process finishes, you may close the modal and review how the objects were tracked. If you notice that the tracked shapes deteriorate, you can adjust their coordinates and run the tracker again from that frame (for a single object or for many objects).\nLimitations and Considerations AI Agent Limitations When using the AI agent implementation, keep in mind:\nSingle Agent Constraint: Only one agent can run at a time for any given tracking function. Running multiple agents may cause random failures as they compete for tracking states. Memory-based State: Tracking states are kept in agent memory. If the agent crashes or is shut down, all tracking states are lost and active tracking processes will fail. Agent-only Usage: Tracking functions can only be used via agents. There is no equivalent of the cvat-cli task auto-annotate command for tracking. Rectangle Limitation: When using the AI Tools dialog (sidebar), only tracking functions that support rectangles will be selectable. The SAM2 tracker supports polygons and masks but not rectangles. Skeleton Tracking: Skeletons cannot currently be tracked by either implementation. Tracker parameters Target frame: Objects will be tracked up to this frame. Must be greater than the current frame Convert polygon shapes to tracks: When enabled, all visible polygon shapes in the current frame will be converted to tracks before tracking begins. Use this option if you need tracks as the final output but started with shapes, produced for example by interactors (e.g. SAM2 or another one).

It is therefore natural to use computing power in annotating datasets. There are multiple publicly available DL models for classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation which can be used for data annotation. Whilst some of these publicly available DL models can be found on CVAT, it is relatively simple to integrate your privately trained ML/DL model into CVAT.\nWith the imperfection of the world, alongside the unavailability of a silver bullet that can solve all our problems; publicly available DL models cannot be used when we want to detect niche or specific objects on which these publicly available models were not trained. As annotation requirements can be sometimes strict, automatically annotated objects cannot be accepted as it is, and it is easier to annotate them from scratch. With these limitations in mind, a DL solution that can perfectly annotate 50% of your data equates to reducing manual annotation by half.\nSince we know DL models can help us to annotate faster, how then do we use them? In CVAT all such DL models are implemented as serverless functions using the Nuclio serverless platform. There are multiple implemented functions that can be found in the serverless directory such as Mask RCNN, Faster RCNN, SiamMask, Inside Outside Guidance, Deep Extreme Cut, etc. Follow the installation guide to build and deploy these serverless functions. See the user guide to understand how to use these functions in the UI to automatically annotate data.\nWhat is a serverless function and why is it used for automatic annotation in CVAT? Let’s assume that you have a DL model and want to use it for AI-assisted annotation. The naive approach is to implement a Python script which uses the DL model to prepare a file with annotations in a public format like MS COCO or Pascal VOC. After that you can upload the annotation file into CVAT. It works but it is not user-friendly. How to make CVAT run the script for you?\nYou can pack the script with your DL model into a container which provides a standard interface for interacting with it. One way to do that is to use the function as a service approach. Your script becomes a function inside cloud infrastructure which can be called over HTTP. The Nuclio serverless platform helps us to implement and manage such functions.\nCVAT supports Nuclio out of the box if it is built properly. See the installation guide for instructions. Thus if you deploy a serverless function, the CVAT server can see it and call it with appropriate arguments. Of course there are some tricks how to create serverless functions for CVAT and we will discuss them in next sections of the tutorial.\nUsing builtin DL models in practice In the tutorial it is assumed that you already have the cloned CVAT GitHub repo. To build CVAT with serverless support you need to run docker compose command with specific configuration files. In the case it is docker-compose.serverless.yml. It has necessary instructions how to build and deploy Nuclio platform as a docker container and enable corresponding support in CVAT.\ndocker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml -f components/serverless/docker-compose.serverless.yml up -d --build docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml -f components/serverless/docker-compose.serverless.yml ps Name Command State Ports ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- cvat /usr/bin/supervisord Up 8080/tcp cvat_db docker-entrypoint.sh postgres Up 5432/tcp cvat_proxy /docker-entrypoint.sh /bin ...

Up (healthy) 80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8070-\u003e8070/tcp,:::8070-\u003e8070/tcp Next step is to deploy builtin serverless functions using Nuclio command line tool (aka nuctl). It is assumed that you followed the installation guide and nuctl is already installed on your operating system. Run the following command to check that it works. In the beginning you should not have any deployed serverless functions.\nnuctl get functions No functions found Let’s see on examples how to use DL models for annotation in different computer vision tasks.\nTracking using TransT (Transformer Tracking) In this use case a user needs to annotate all individual objects on a video as tracks. Basically for every object we need to know its location on every frame.\nFirst step is to deploy TransT. The deployment process can depend on your operating system. On Linux you can use serverless/deploy_cpu.sh auxiliary script, but below we are using nuctl directly.\nnuctl create project cvat --platform local nuctl deploy --project-name cvat --path serverless/pytorch/dschoerk/transt/nuclio --platform local 25.12.08 14:09:38.783 (I) nuctl Deploying function {\"name\": \"pth-dschoerk-transt\"} 25.12.08 14:09:38.783 (I) nuctl Building {\"builderKind\": \"docker\", \"versionInfo\": \"Label: 1.15.9, Git commit: ad1fde3b47fcd9035f3f0eea45b2ff654655e8be, OS: linux, Arch: amd64, Go version: go1.25.4\", \"name\": \"pth-dschoerk-transt\"} 25.12.08 14:09:38.992 (I) nuctl Staging files and preparing base images 25.12.08 14:09:38.995 (W) nuctl Using user provided base image, runtime interpreter version is provided by the base image {\"baseImage\": \"ubuntu:22.04\"} 25.12.08 14:09:38.995 (I) nuctl Building processor image {\"registryURL\": \"\", \"taggedImageName\": \"cvat.pth.dschoerk.transt:latest\"} 25.12.08 14:09:38.995 (I) nuctl.platform.docker Pulling image {\"imageName\": \"quay.io/nuclio/handler-builder-python-onbuild:1.15.9-amd64\"} 25.12.08 14:09:41.414 (I) nuctl.platform.docker Pulling image {\"imageName\": \"gcr.io/iguazio/uhttpc:0.0.3-amd64\"} 25.12.08 14:09:43.140 (I) nuctl.platform Building docker image {\"image\": \"cvat.pth.dschoerk.transt:latest\"} 25.12.08 14:09:52.744 (I) nuctl.platform Pushing docker image into registry {\"image\": \"cvat.pth.dschoerk.transt:latest\", \"registry\": \"\"} 25.12.08 14:09:52.744 (I) nuctl.platform Docker image was successfully built and pushed into docker registry {\"image\": \"cvat.pth.dschoerk.transt:latest\"} 25.12.08 14:09:52.745 (I) nuctl Build complete {\"image\": \"cvat.pth.dschoerk.transt:latest\"} 25.12.08 14:09:52.751 (I) nuctl Cleaning up before deployment {\"functionName\": \"pth-dschoerk-transt\"} 25.12.08 14:09:53.433 (I) nuctl.platform Waiting for function to be ready {\"timeout\": 120} 25.12.08 14:09:55.304 (I) nuctl Function deploy complete {\"functionName\": \"pth-dschoerk-transt\", \"httpPort\": 32771, \"internalInvocationURLs\": [\"172.17.0.4:8080\"], \"externalInvocationURLs\": [\"0.0.0.0:32771\"]} nuctl get functions --platform local NAMESPACE | NAME | PROJECT | STATE | REPLICAS | NODE PORT nuclio | pth-dschoerk-transt | cvat | ready | 1/1 | 32771 Let’s see how it works in the UI. Go to the models tab and check that you can see TransT in the list. If you cannot, it means that there are some problems. Go to one of our public channels and ask for help.\nAfter that, go to the new task page and create a task with this video file. You can choose any task name, any labels, and even another video file if you like. In this case, the Remote sources option was used to specify the video file. Press submit button at the end to finish the process.\nOpen the task and use AI tools to start tracking an object. Draw a bounding box around an object, and sequentially switch through the frame and correct the restrictive box if necessary.\nFinally you will get bounding boxes.\nTransT model is more optimized to work on Nvidia GPUs.\nFor more information about deploying the model for the GPU, read on. Object detection using YOLO-v3 First of all let’s deploy the DL model. The deployment process is similar for all serverless functions. Need to run nuctl deploy command with appropriate arguments. To simplify the process, you can use serverless/deploy_cpu.sh command. Inference of the serverless function is optimized for CPU using Intel OpenVINO framework.\nserverless/deploy_cpu.sh serverless/openvino/omz/public/yolo-v3-tf/ Deploying

Do not forget to save annotations.\nAlso it is possible to run a detector for the whole annotation task. Thus CVAT will run the serverless function on every frame of the task and submit results directly into database. For more details please read the guide.\nObject segmentation using Segment Anything If you have an interactor that returns masks, you can use it to segment objects. One such interactor is Segment Anything. Several implementations are available out of the box:\nserverless/pytorch/facebookresearch/sam/ Includes two versions: one optimized for CPU and another for GPU. Deploying a serverless function optimized for GPU follows a similar process. You only need to run the serverless/deploy_gpu.sh script, which executes the same commands but utilizes the function-gpu.yaml configuration file instead of function.yaml. See the following sections for details on the differences.\nNote: Please do not run several GPU functions at the same time. In many cases, it will not work out of the box. For now, you should manually schedule different functions on different GPUs and it requires source code modification.

In your case it can be your own model. If it is based on detectron2 it will be easy to integrate. Just follow the tutorial.\nDetectron2 is Facebook AI Research’s next generation library that provides state-of-the-art detection and segmentation algorithms. It is the successor of Detectron and maskrcnn-benchmark. It supports a number of computer vision research projects and production applications in Facebook.\nClone the repository somewhere. I assume that all other experiments will be run from the cloned detectron2 directory.\ngit clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2 cd detectron2 Run local experiments Let’s run a detection model locally. First of all need to install requirements for the library.\nIn my case I have Ubuntu 20.04 with python 3.8.5. I installed PyTorch 1.8.1 for Linux with pip, python, and CPU inside a virtual environment. Follow opencv-python installation guide to get the library for demo and visualization.\npython3 -m venv .detectron2 . .detectron2/bin/activate pip install torch==1.8.1+cpu torchvision==0.9.1+cpu torchaudio==0.8.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html pip install opencv-python Install the detectron2 library from your local clone (you should be inside detectron2 directory).\npython -m pip install -e . After the library from Facebook AI Research is installed, we can run a couple of experiments. See the official tutorial for more examples. I decided to experiment with RetinaNet. First step is to download model weights.\ncurl -O https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron2/COCO-Detection/retinanet_R_101_FPN_3x/190397697/model_final_971ab9.pkl To run experiments let’s download an image with cats from wikipedia.\ncurl -O https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Cat_poster_1.jpg/1920px-Cat_poster_1.jpg Finally let’s run the DL model inference on CPU. If all is fine, you will see a window with cats and bounding boxes around them with scores.\npython demo/demo.py --config-file configs/COCO-Detection/retinanet_R_101_FPN_3x.yaml \\ --input 1920px-Cat_poster_1.jpg --opts MODEL.WEIGHTS model_final_971ab9.pkl MODEL.DEVICE cpu Next step is to minimize demo/demo.py script and keep code which is necessary to load, run, and interpret output of the model only. Let’s hard code parameters and remove argparse. Keep only code which is responsible for working with an image. There is no common advice how to minimize some code.\nFinally you should get something like the code below which has fixed config, read a predefined image, initialize predictor, and run inference. As the final step it prints all detected bounding boxes with scores and labels.\nfrom detectron2.config import get_cfg from detectron2.data.detection_utils import read_image from detectron2.engine.defaults import DefaultPredictor from detectron2.data.datasets.builtin_meta import COCO_CATEGORIES CONFIG_FILE = \"configs/COCO-Detection/retinanet_R_101_FPN_3x.yaml\" CONFIG_OPTS = [\"MODEL.WEIGHTS\", \"model_final_971ab9.pkl\", \"MODEL.DEVICE\", \"cpu\"] CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.5 def setup_cfg(): cfg = get_cfg() cfg.merge_from_file(CONFIG_FILE) cfg.merge_from_list(CONFIG_OPTS) cfg.MODEL.RETINANET.SCORE_THRESH_TEST = CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD cfg.MODEL.ROI_HEADS.SCORE_THRESH_TEST = CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD cfg.MODEL.PANOPTIC_FPN.COMBINE.INSTANCES_CONFIDENCE_THRESH = CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD cfg.freeze() return cfg if __name__ == \"__main__\": cfg = setup_cfg() input = \"1920px-Cat_poster_1.jpg\" img = read_image(input, format=\"BGR\") predictor = DefaultPredictor(cfg) predictions = predictor(img) instances = predictions['instances'] pred_boxes = instances.pred_boxes scores = instances.scores pred_classes = instances.pred_classes for box, score, label in zip(pred_boxes, scores, pred_classes): label = COCO_CATEGORIES[int(label)][\"name\"] print(box.tolist(), float(score), label) DL model as a serverless function When we know how to run the DL model locally, we can prepare a serverless function which can be used by CVAT to annotate data. Let’s see how function.yaml will look like…\nLet’s look at faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco serverless function configuration as an example and try adapting it to our case. First of all let’s invent an unique name for the new function: pth-facebookresearch-detectron2-retinanet-r101. Section annotations describes our function for CVAT serverless subsystem:\nannotations.name is a display name annotations.type is a type of the serverless function. It can have several different values. Basically it affects input and output of the function. In our case it has detector type and it means that the integrated DL model can generate shapes with labels for an image. annotations.framework is used for information only and can have arbitrary value. Usually it has values like OpenVINO, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc. annotations.spec describes the list of labels which the model supports. In the case the DL model was trained on MS COCO dataset and the list of labels correspond to the dataset. spec.description is used to provide basic information for the model. All other parameters are described in Nuclio documentation.\nspec.handler is the entry point to your function. spec.runtime is the name of the language runtime. spec.eventTimeout is the global event timeout Next step is to describe how to build our serverless function:\nspec.build.image is the name of your docker image spec.build.baseImage is the name of a base container image from which to build the function spec.build.directives are commands to build your docker image In our case we start from Ubuntu 20.04 base image, install curl to download weights for our model, git to clone detectron2 project from GitHub, and python together with pip. Repeat installation steps which we used to setup the DL model locally with minor modifications.\nFor Nuclio platform we have to specify a couple of more parameters:\nspec.triggers.myHttpTrigger describes HTTP trigger to handle incoming HTTP requests. spec.platform describes some important parameters to run your functions like restartPolicy and mountMode. Read Nuclio documentation for more details. metadata: name: pth-facebookresearch-detectron2-retinanet-r101 namespace: cvat annotations: name: RetinaNet R101 type: detector spec: | [ { \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"person\" }, { \"id\": 2, \"name\": \"bicycle\" }, ... { \"id\":89, \"name\": \"hair_drier\" }, { \"id\":90, \"name\": \"toothbrush\" } ] spec: description: RetinaNet R101 from Detectron2 runtime: 'python:3.10' handler: main:handler eventTimeout: 30s build: image: cvat.pth.facebookresearch.detectron2.retinanet_r101 baseImage: ubuntu:22.04 directives: preCopy: - kind: ENV value: DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive - kind: RUN value: |- apt-get update \\ \u0026\u0026 apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \\ curl \\ git \\ g++ \\ ca-certificates \\ python-is-python3 \\ python3 \\ python3-dev \\ python3-pip \\ \u0026\u0026 rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* - kind: RUN value: |- pip install \\ torch==1.13.1+cpu torchvision==0.14.1+cpu numpy==1.26.4 \\ --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu \\ --no-cache-dir - kind: RUN value: pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2@ff53992b1985' --no-cache-dir - kind: WORKDIR value: /opt/nuclio - kind: RUN value: curl -O https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron2/COCO-Detection/retinanet_R_101_FPN_3x/190397697/model_final_971ab9.pkl triggers: myHttpTrigger: numWorkers: 2 kind: 'http' workerAvailabilityTimeoutMilliseconds: 10000 attributes: maxRequestBodySize: 33554432 # 32MB platform: attributes: restartPolicy: name: always maximumRetryCount: 3 mountMode: volume Full code can be found here: detectron2/retinanet/nuclio/function.yaml\nNext step is to adapt our source code which we implemented to run the DL model locally to requirements of Nuclio platform. First step is to load the model into memory using init_context(context) function. Read more about the function in Best Practices and Common Pitfalls.\nAfter that we need to accept incoming HTTP requests, run inference, reply with detection results. For the process our entry point is responsible which we specified in our function specification handler(context, event). Again in accordance to function specification the entry point should be located inside main.py.\ndef init_context(context): context.logger.info(\"Init context... 0%\") cfg = get_config('COCO-Detection/retinanet_R_101_FPN_3x.yaml') cfg.merge_from_list(CONFIG_OPTS) cfg.MODEL.RETINANET.SCORE_THRESH_TEST = CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD cfg.MODEL.ROI_HEADS.SCORE_THRESH_TEST = CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD cfg.MODEL.PANOPTIC_FPN.COMBINE.INSTANCES_CONFIDENCE_THRESH = CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD cfg.freeze() predictor = DefaultPredictor(cfg) context.user_data.model_handler = predictor context.logger.info(\"Init context...100%\") def handler(context, event): context.logger.info(\"Run retinanet-R101 model\") data = event.body buf = io.BytesIO(base64.b64decode(data[\"image\"])) threshold = float(data.get(\"threshold\", 0.5)) image = convert_PIL_to_numpy(Image.open(buf), format=\"BGR\") predictions = context.user_data.model_handler(image) instances = predictions['instances'] pred_boxes = instances.pred_boxes scores = instances.scores pred_classes = instances.pred_classes results = [] for box, score, label in zip(pred_boxes, scores, pred_classes): label = COCO_CATEGORIES[int(label)][\"name\"] if score \u003e= threshold: results.append({ \"confidence\": str(float(score)), \"label\": label, \"points\": box.tolist(), \"type\": \"rectangle\", }) return context.Response(body=json.dumps(results), headers={}, content_type='application/json', status_code=200) Full code can be found here: detectron2/retinanet/nuclio/main.py\nDeploy RetinaNet serverless function To use the new serverless function you have to deploy it using nuctl command.

Theoretically it is possible to run different functions on different GPUs, but it requires to change source code on corresponding serverless functions to choose a free GPU.\nDebugging a serverless function Let’s say you have a problem with your serverless function and want to debug it. Of course you can use context.logger.info or similar methods to print the intermediate state of your function. Another way is to debug using Visual Studio Code. Please see instructions below to setup your environment step by step.\nLet’s modify our function.yaml to include debugpy package and specify that maxWorkers count is 1. Otherwise both workers will try to use the same port and it will lead to an exception in python code.\n- kind: RUN value: pip3 install debugpy triggers: myHttpTrigger: maxWorkers: 1 Change main.py to listen to a port (e.g. 5678). Insert code below in the beginning of your file with entry point.\nimport debugpy debugpy.listen(5678) After these changes deploy the serverless function once again. For serverless/pytorch/facebookresearch/detectron2/retinanet/nuclio/ you should run the command below:\nserverless/deploy_cpu.sh serverless/pytorch/facebookresearch/detectron2/retinanet To debug python code inside a container you have to publish the port (in this tutorial it is 5678). Nuclio deploy command doesn’t support that and we have to workaround it using SSH port forwarding.\nInstall SSH server on your host machine using sudo apt install openssh-server In /etc/ssh/sshd_config host file set GatewayPorts yes Restart ssh service to apply changes using sudo systemctl restart ssh.service Next step is to install ssh client inside the container and run port forwarding. In the snippet below instead of user and ipaddress provide username and IP address of your host (usually IP address starts from 192.168.). You will need to confirm that you want to connect to your host computer and enter your password. Keep the terminal open after that.\ndocker exec -it nuclio-nuclio-pth-facebookresearch-detectron2-retinanet-r101 /bin/bash apt update \u0026\u0026 apt install -y ssh ssh -R 5678:localhost:5678 user@ipaddress See how the latest command looks like in my case:\nroot@2d6cceec8f70:/opt/nuclio# ssh -R 5678:localhost:5678 nmanovic@192.168.50.188 The authenticity of host '192.168.50.188 (192.168.50.188)' can't be established.

It allows you to perform mutual conversion between masks, polygons and rectangles.\nNote All shapes converter work only when the filter is set up. See:\nRun actions menu Convert shapes Convert shapes video tutorial Run actions menu Annotations actions can be accessed from the annotation menu. To access it, click on the burger icon and then select Run actions.\nNote All Shapes converter functions work in alignment with set up filter. You will see the following dialog:\nWith the following fields:\nField Description Select action Drop-down list with available actions: Remove filtered shapes - removes all shapes in alignment with the set-up filter. Doesn’t work with tracks.Propagate shapes - propagates all the filtered shapes from the current frame to the target frame.Shapes converter: masks to polygons - converts all masks to polygons.Shapes converter: masks to rectangles - converts all masks to rectangles in alignment with the set-up filter.Shapes converter: polygon to masks - converts all polygons to masks.Shapes converter: polygon to rectangles - converts all polygons to rectangles.Shapes converter: rectangles to masks - converts all rectangles to masks.Shapes converter: rectangles to polygons - converts all rectangles to polygons.\nNote: only Propagate shapes and Remove filtered shapes is available in the community version. Specify frames to run action Field where you can specify the frame range for the selected action. Enter the starting frame in the Starting from frame: field, and the ending frame in the up to frame field.

Convert shapes Recommended Precautions Before Running Annotation Actions\nSaving changes: It is recommended to save all changes prior to initiating the annotation action. If unsaved changes are detected, a prompt will advise to save these changes to avoid any potential loss of data.\nDisable auto-save: Prior to running the annotation action, disabling the auto-save feature is advisable. A notification will suggest this action if auto-save is currently active.\nCommitting changes: Changes applied during the annotation session will not be committed to the server until the saving process is manually initiated. This can be done either by the user or through the auto-save feature, should it be enabled.\nTo convert shapes, do the following:\nAnnotate your dataset.\nSet up filters.\nFrom the burger menu, select Run actions.\nChoose the action you need from the Select action drop-down list.\n(Optional) In the Starting from frame field, enter the frame number where the action should begin, and in the up to frame field, specify the frame number where the action should end.\n(Optional) Select an option from Or choose one of the predefined options to apply the action.\nClick Run. A progress bar will appear. You may abort the process by clicking Cancel until the process commits modified objects at the end of pipeline.\nNote Once the action is applied, it cannot be undone.

To manage users’ permission, in the Django administration panel:\nOn the left menu click Users. On the main pane click Admin and scroll down to Permissions section. Select user groups and add/remove permissions. Changing a user’s password As a superuser, you can manually change passwords for other users through the Django administration panel. This is useful when users cannot use the “Forgot password” feature (e.g., when email is not configured or user email addresses are invalid).\nTo change a user’s password:\nGo to the Django administration panel.

In the upper left corner, there is a search bar, using which you can find the task by assignee, task name etc. In the upper right corner, there are sorting, quick filters, and filter.\nFilter Note Applying a filter disables the quick filter. The filter works similarly to the filters for annotation, you can create rules from properties, operators, and values and group rules into groups. For more details, consult the filter section. Learn more about date and time selection.\nFor clear all filters press Clear filters.\nSupported properties for tasks list Properties Supported values Description Dimension 2D or 3D Depends on the data format (read more in creating an annotation task) Status annotation, validation or completed Data video, images Depends on the data format (read more in creating an annotation task) Subset test, train, validation or custom subset learn more Assignee username Assignee is the user who is working on the project, task or job (they are specified on task page) Owner username The user who owns the project, task, or job Last updated last modified date and time (or value range) The date can be entered in the dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm format or by selecting the date in the window that appears when you click on the input field ID number or range of job ID Project ID number or range of project ID Name name On the tasks page: name of the task,\non the project page: name of the project Project name project name Specified when creating a project, can be changed on the (project section) Select Open to go to task details.\nTask details page Task details is a task page that contains a preview, a progress bar, the details of the task (specified when the task was created), and the Jobs section.\nThe next actions are available on this page:\nChange the task’s title.\nOpen Actions menu.\nChange the issue tracker or open it if specified.\nChange labels (available only if the task is not related to the project).\nYou can add new labels or add attributes for the existing labels in the Raw mode or the Constructor mode. By selecting Copy you will copy the labels to the clipboard.\nAssigned to — is used to assign a task to a person. Start typing an assignee’s name and/or choose the right person out of the dropdown list. In the list of users, you will only see the users of the organization where the task is created.\nCloud storage — view the cloud storage attached to the task and change it to another attached storage if needed.\nJobs is a list of all jobs for a particular task. Here you can find the next data:\nJobs name with a hyperlink to it. Frame range — the frame interval. A stage of the job. The stage is specified by a drop-down list. There are three stages: annotation, validation, or acceptance. This value affects the task progress bar. A state of the job. The state can be changed by an assigned user in the menu inside the job. There are several possible states: new, in progress, rejected, completed. Duration — is the amount of time the job is being worked. Assignee is the user who is working on the job (annotator, reviewer, or corrector). You can start typing an assignee’s name and/or choose the right person out of the dropdown list. You can filter or sort jobs by status, assignee, and updated date using the filters panel.\nFollow a link inside Jobs section to start the annotation process. In some cases, you can have several links. It depends on the size of your task and Overlap Size and Segment Size parameters. To improve UX, only the first chunk of several frames will be loaded and you will be able to annotate the first images. Other frames will be loaded in the background.\nHow to create and configure an annotation task To start annotating in CVAT, you must create an annotation task and specify its parameters.\nCreate a task To create a task:\nOn the Tasks page, select + Select Create new task. Next, specify the task parameters in the configurator:\nIn the Name field, enter the name of the new task.\n(Optional) From the Projects drop-down, select a project for the new task. Leave this field empty if you do not want to assign the task to any project.\nNote Following steps are valid if the task does not belong to a project. If the task has been assigned to a project, the project’s labels will be applied to the task. On the Constructor tab, select Add label. The label constructor menu will open:\nIn the Label name field, enter the name of the label.\n(Optional) To limit the use of the label to a certain shape tool, from the Label shape drop-down select the shape.\n(Optional) Select the color for the label.\n(Optional) Select Add an attribute and set up its properties.\nSelect Select files to upload files for annotation.\nSelect Continue to submit the label and start adding a new one or Cancel to terminate the current label and return you to the labels list.\nSelect Submit and open to submit the configuration and open the created task, or Submit and continue, to submit the configuration and start a new task.\nLabel shape Labels (or classes) are categories of objects that you can annotate.\nLabel shape limits the use of the label to certain shape tool.\nAny is the default setting that does not limit the use of the label to any particular shape tool.\nFor example, if you added:\nLabel sun with the Label shape type ellipse Label car with the Label shape type any As a result:\nThe sun label will be available only for ellipse shape.\nThe car label will be available for all shapes.\nThe tools on the Controls sidebar will be limited to the selected types of shapes.\nFor example, if you select Any, all tools will be available, but if you select Rectangle for all labels, only the Rectangle tool will be visible on the sidebar.\nNote You cannot apply the Label shape to the AI and OpenCV tools, these tools will always be available. You can change the shape of the label as needed. This change will not affect the existing annotation.\nFor example, if you created objects using polygons and then changed the label shape to polylines, all previously created objects will remain polygons. However, you will not be able to add new polygon objects with the same label.\nNote You cannot change the shape of the skeleton label. The Label shape field for the skeleton label is disabled. Add an attribute Attribute is a property of an annotated object, such as color, model, or other quality.\nFor example, you have a label for face and want to specify the type of face. Instead of creating additional labels for male and female, you can use attributes to add this information.\nThere are two types of attributes:\nImmutable attributes are unique and do not change from frame to frame. For example, age, gender, and color. Mutable attributes are temporary and can change from frame to frame. For example, pose, quality, and truncated. Added attributes will be available from the Objects menu:\nTo add an attribute:\nGo to the Constructor tab and select Add attribute.\nIn the Name field, enter the attribute name.\nIn the drop-down menu, select the way to display the attribute in the Objects menu:\nSelect enables a drop-down list, from which you can select an attribute. If in the Attribute value field you add __undefined__, the drop-down list will have a blank value.\nThis is useful for cases where the attribute of the object cannot be clarified:\nRadio enables the selection of one option from several options.\nCheckbox enables the selection of multiple options.\nText sets the attribute to a text field.\nNumber sets the attribute to numerical field in the following format: min;max;step.\nIn the Attribute values field, add attribute values. To separate values use Enter. To delete value, use Backspace or click x next to the value name.\n(Optional) For mutable attributes, select Mutable.\n(Optional) To set an attribute value as default, select it. The default value will change color to blue.\nTo delete an attribute, select Delete attribute.\nSelect files There are several ways to upload files:\nData source Description My computer Use this option to select files from your laptop or PC. To select file: 1. Select Select files field: . 2. Select files to upload. Connected file share Advanced option. Upload files from a local or cloud shared folder. Note, that you need to mount a fileshare first. For more information, consult Share path Remote source Enter a list of URLs (one per line) in the field. Cloud Storage Advanced option. To upload files from cloud storage, type the cloud storage name, (optional) choose the manifest file, and select the required files. For more information, consult Attach cloud storage. Use the search feature to find a file (by file name) from the connected cloud storage. Editing labels in RAW format The Raw is a way of working with labels for an advanced user.\nIt is useful when you need to copy labels from one independent task to another.\nNote Be careful with changing the raw specification of an existing task/project. Removing any “id” properties will lead to losing existing annotations. This property will be removed automatically from any text you insert to this field. Raw presents label data in .json format with an option of editing and copying labels as text. The Done button applies the changes and the Reset button cancels the changes.\nData formats for a 3D task To create a 3D task, you must prepare an archive with one of the following directory structures.\nNote You can’t mix 2D and 3D data in the same task. Velodyne 3D pointcloud 3D Option 1 3D Option 2 VELODYNE FORMAT Structure: velodyne_points/ data/ image_01.bin IMAGE_00 # unknown dirname, # generally image_01.png can be under IMAGE_00, IMAGE_01, IMAGE_02, IMAGE_03, etc data/ image_01.png 3D POINTCLOUD DATA FORMAT Structure: pointcloud/ 00001.pcd related_images/ 00001_pcd/ image_01.png # or any other image 3D, DEFAULT DATAFORMAT Option 1 Structure: data/ image.pcd image.png 3D, DEFAULT DATAFORMAT Option 2 Structure: data/ image_1/ image_1.pcd context_1.png # or any other name context_2.jpg Advanced configuration Use advanced configuration to set additional parameters for the task and customize it to meet specific needs or requirements.\nThe following parameters are available:\nElement Description Sorting method Note: Does not work for the video data. Several methods to sort the data. For example, the sequence 2.jpeg, 10.jpeg, 1.jpeg after sorting will be: Lexicographical: 1.jpeg, 10.jpeg, 2.jpeg Natural: 1.jpeg, 2.jpeg, 10.jpeg Predefined: 2.jpeg, 10.jpeg, 1.jpeg Random uploads data in random order. Prefer zip chunks Use this parameter to divide your video or image dataset for annotation into short video clips a zip file of frames. Zip files are larger but do not require decoding on the client side, and video clips are smaller but require decoding. It is recommended to turn off this parameter for video tasks to reduce traffic between the client side and the server. Use cache Select the checkbox to enable on-the-fly data processing to reduce task creation time and store data in a cache with a policy of evicting less popular items. For more information, see Data preparation on the fly. Image quality CVAT has two types of data: original quality and compressed. Original quality images are used for dataset export\nand automatic annotation. Compressed images are used only for annotations to reduce traffic between the server and client side. It is recommended to adjust the compression level only if the images contain small objects that are not visible in the original quality. Values range from 5 (highly compressed images) to 100 (not compressed). Overlap size Use this parameter to create overlapped segments, making tracking continuous from one segment to another. Note that this functionality only works for bounding boxes. This parameter has the following options: Interpolation task (video sequence). If you annotate with a bounding box on two adjacent segments, they will be\nmerged into a single bounding box. In case the overlap is zero or the bounding box is inaccurate (not enclosing the object properly, misaligned or distorted) on the adjacent segments, it may be difficult to accurately interpolate the object’s movement between the segments. As a result, multiple tracks will be created for the same object. Annotation task (independent images). If an object exists on overlapped segments with overlap greater than zero, and the annotation of these segments is done properly, then the segments will be automatically merged into a single\nobject. If the overlap is zero or the annotation is inaccurate (not enclosing the object properly, misaligned, distorted) on the\nadjacent segments, it may be difficult to accurately track the object. As a result, multiple bounding boxes will be created for the same object. If the annotations on different segments (on overlapped frames) are very different, you will have two shapes for the same object. To avoid this, accurately annotate the object on the first segment and the same object on the second segment to create a track between two annotations. Segment size Use this parameter to divide a dataset into smaller parts. For example, if you want to share a dataset among multiple\nannotators, you can split it into smaller sections and assign each section to a separate job. This allows annotators to work on the same dataset concurrently. Start frame Defines the first frame of the video. Stop frame Defines the last frame of the video. Frame step Use this parameter to filter video frames or images in a dataset. Specify frame step value to include only certain frames or images in the dataset. For example, if the frame step value is 25, the dataset will include every 25th frame or image. If a video has 100 frames, setting the frame step to 25 will include only frames 1, 26, 51, 76, and 100 in the dataset. This can be useful for reducing the size of the dataset, or for focusing on specific frames or images\nof particular interest. Chunk size Defines amount of frames to be packed in a chunk when send from client to server. The server defines automatically if the chunk is empty. Recommended values: 1080p or less: 36 2k or less: 8 16 - 4k or less: 4 8 - More: 1 - 4 Issue tracker Use this parameter to specify the issue tracker URL. Source storage Specify the source storage for importing resources like annotations and backups. If the task was assigned to the project, use the Use project source storage toggle to determine whether to use project values or specify new ones. Target storage Specify the target storage (local or cloud) for exporting resources like annotations and backups. If the task is created in the project, use the Use project target storage toggle to determine whether to\nuse project values or specify new ones. To save and open the task, select Submit \u0026 Open .\nTo create several tasks in sequence, select Submit \u0026 Continue.\nCreated tasks will be displayed on the tasks page.\nHow to create and set up multiple tasks Use Create multi tasks to create multiple video annotation tasks with the same configuration.\nNote The Create multi tasks feature is available for videos only. Check out:\nCreate multi tasks Example Errors Advanced configuration Create multi tasks To create the multi tasks:\nOn the Tasks page select +. Select Create multi tasks. Next, specify the parameters in the task configurator:\nIn the Name field, enter the name of the new task:\nEnter the name of the task (Optional) {{index}} adds an index to the file in the set (starting from 0). (Optional) {{file_name}} adds the file’s name to the task’s name. (Optional) From the Projects drop-down, select a project for the tasks. Leave this field empty if you do not want to assign tasks to any project.\nNote Following steps are valid if the tasks do not belong to a project. If the tasks have been assigned to a project, the project’s labels will be applied to the tasks. On the Constructor tab, select Add label.\nIn the Label name field, enter the name of the label.\n(Optional) Select the color for the label.\n(Optional) Select Add an attribute and set up its properties.\nSelect Select files to upload files for annotation.\nNote You cannot upload multiple tasks from the cloud storage. Select Submit N tasks\nExample A step-by-step example for creating the multiple tasks:\nIn the Name field, enter the Create_multitask-{{index}}-{{file_name}}.\nAdd labels.\nSelect files. In case there are more than four files, only the total number of selected files will be displayed: Select Submit N tasks\nYou will see a progress bar that shows the progress of the tasks being created:\nSelect Ok.\nThe result will look like the following:\nErrors During the process of adding multiple tasks, the following errors may occur:\nError Description Wrong file format. You can add only video files. In the process of creating a task, CVAT was not able to process the video file. The name of the failed file will be displayed on the progress bar. To fix this issue: If you want to try again, click Retry failed tasks. If you want to skip the file, click OK. Advanced configuration Use advanced configuration to set additional parameters for the task and customize it to meet specific needs or requirements.\nFor more information, consult Advanced configuration\nHow to delete a frame from a task You can delete the current frame from a task. This frame will not be presented either in the UI or in the exported annotation. Thus, it is possible to mark corrupted frames that are not subject to annotation.\nGo to the Job annotation view and click on the Delete frame button (Alt+Del).\nNote When you delete with the shortcut, the frame will be deleted immediately without additional confirmation. After that you will be asked to confirm frame deleting.\nNote all annotations from that frame will be deleted, unsaved annotations will be saved and the frame will be invisible in the annotation view (Until you make it visible in the settings). If there is some overlap in the task and the deleted frame falls within this interval, then this will cause this frame to become unavailable in another job as well. When you delete a frame in a job with tracks, you may need to adjust some tracks manually. Common adjustments are:\nAdd keyframes at the edges of the deleted interval for the interpolation to look correct; Move the keyframe start or end keyframe to the correct side of the deleted interval. Configure deleted frames visibility and navigation If you need to enable showing the deleted frames, you can do it in the settings.\nGo to the settings and chose Player settings.\nClick on the Show deleted frames checkbox. And close the settings dialog.\nThen you will be able to navigate through deleted frames. But annotation tools will be unavailable. Deleted frames differ in the corresponding overlay.\nThere are ways to navigate through deleted frames without enabling this option:\nGo to the frame via direct navigation methods: navigation slider or frame input field, Go to the frame via the direct link, for example: /api/tasks/{id}/jobs/{id}?frame={frame_id}. Navigation with step will not count deleted frames.\nRestore deleted frame You can also restore deleted frames in the task.\nTurn on deleted frames visibility, as it was told in the previous part, and go to the deleted frame you want to restore.\nClick on the Restore icon. The frame will be restored immediately.\n","categories":"","description":"Overview of the Tasks page.","excerpt":"Overview of the Tasks page.","ref":"/docs/workspace/tasks-page/","tags":"","title":"Tasks"},{"body":"CVAT offers two distinct types of roles:\nGlobal Roles: These are universal roles that apply to the entire system. Anyone who logs into the CVAT platform is automatically assigned a global role. It sets the basic permissions that every registered user has across CVAT, regardless of their specific tasks or responsibilities. Organization Roles: These roles determine what a user can do within the Organization, allowing for more tailored access based on the user’s specific duties and responsibilities. Organization roles complement global roles by determining the visibility of different resources for example, tasks or jobs.\nLimits: Limits are applicable to all users of CVAT Online using the Free plan and can be lifted upon choosing a subscription.\nAll roles are predefined and cannot be modified through the user interface. However, within the self-hosted solution, roles can be adjusted using .rego files stored in cvat/apps/*/rules/. Rego is a declarative language employed for defining OPA (Open Policy Agent) policies, and its syntax is detailed in the OPA documentation.\nNote Once you’ve made changes to the .rego files, you must rebuild and restart the Docker Compose for those changes to be applied. In this scenario, be sure to include the docker-compose.dev.yml compose configuration file when executing the Docker Compose command. See:\nGlobal roles in CVAT Organization roles in CVAT Job Stage Global roles in CVAT Note Global roles can be adjusted only on self-hosted solution. CVAT has implemented three Global roles, categorized as user Groups. These roles are:\nRole Description Administrator An administrator possesses unrestricted access to the CVAT instance and all activities within this instance. The administrator has visibility over all tasks and projects, with the ability to modify or manage each comprehensively. This role is exclusive to self-hosted instances, ensuring comprehensive oversight and control. User (default role) A User is a default role who is assigned to any user who is registered in CVAT*. Users can view and manage all tasks and projects within their registered accounts, but their activities are subject to specific limitations, see Free plan. * If a user, that did not have a CVAT account, has been invited to the organization by the organization owner or maintainer, it will be automatically assigned the Organization role and will be subject to the role’s limitations when operating within the Organization. Worker Workers are limited to specific functionalities and do not have the permissions to create tasks, assign roles, or perform other administrative actions. Their activities are primarily focused on viewing and interacting with the content within the boundaries of their designated roles (validation or annotation of the jobs). Organization roles in CVAT Organization Roles are available only within the CVAT Organization.\nOrganization roles are assigned when users are invited to the Organization.\nThere are the following roles available in CVAT:\nRole Description Owner The Owner is the person who created the Organization. The Owner role is assigned to the creator of the organization by default. This role has maximum capabilities and cannot be changed or assigned to the other user. The Owner has no extra restrictions in the organization and is only limited by the chosen organization plan (see Free and Team plans). Owners can invite other users to the Organization and assign roles to the invited users so the team can collaborate. Maintainer The maintainer is the person who can invite users to organization, create and update tasks and jobs, and see all tasks within the organization. Maintainer has complete access to Cloud Storages, and the ability to modify members and their roles. Supervisor The supervisor is a manager role. Supervisor can create and assign jobs, tasks, and projects to the Organization members. Supervisor cannot invite new members and modify members roles. Worker Workers’ primary focus is actual annotation and reviews. They are limited to specific functionalities and has access only to the jobs assigned to them. Job Stage Job Stage can be assigned to any team member.\nStages are not roles.\nJobs can have an assigned user (with any role) and that Assignee will perform a Stage specific work which is to annotate, validate, or accept the job.\nJob Stage can be:\nStage Description Annotation Provides access to annotation tools. Assignees will be able to see their assigned jobs and annotate them. By default, assignees with the Annotation stage cannot report annotation errors or issues. Validation Grants access to QA tools. Assignees will see their assigned jobs and can validate them while also reporting issues. By default, assignees with the Validation stage cannot correct errors or annotate datasets. Acceptance Does not grant any additional access or change the annotator’s interface. It just marks the job as done. Any Assignee can modify their assigned Stage specific functions via the annotation interface toolbar:\nStandard: switches interface to Annotation mode. Review: switches interface to the Validation mode.

To estimate the task quality, CVAT compares all other jobs in the task against the established Ground truth job, and calculates annotation quality based on this comparison.\nNote Quality estimation only supports 2d tasks. It supports all the annotation types except 2d cuboids. Note Quality estimation is available for projects, tasks, and jobs. CVAT has the following features for automated quality control of annotations:\nValidation set configuration for a task Job validation on job finish (“Immediate feedback”) Review mode for problems found Quality analytics Basics There are several approaches to quality estimation used in the industry. In CVAT, we can use a method known as Ground Truth or Honeypots. The method assumes there are Ground Truth annotations for images in the dataset. This method is statistical, which means that we can use only a small portion of the whole dataset to estimate quality on the full dataset, so we don’t need to annotate the whole dataset twice. Here we assume that the images in the dataset are similar (represent the same task).\nWe will call the validation portion of the whole dataset (or a task in CVAT) a validation set. In practice, it is typically expected that annotations in the validation set are carefully validated and curated. It means that they are more expensive - creating them might require expert annotators or just several iterations of annotation and validation. It means that it’s desirable to keep the validation set small enough. At the same time, it must be representative enough to provide reliable estimations. To achieve this, it’s advised that the validation set images are sampled randomly and independently from the full dataset. That is, for the quality assurance to function correctly, the validation set must have some portion of the task frames, and the frames must be chosen randomly.\nDepending on the dataset size, data variance, and task complexity, 5-15% of the data is typically good enough for quality estimation, while keeping extra annotation overhead for the Ground Truth acceptable.\nFor example, in a typical task with 2000 frames, selecting just 5%, which is 100 extra frames to annotate, is enough to estimate the annotation quality. If the task contains only 30 frames, it’s advisable to select 8-10 frames, which is about 30%. It is more than 15%, but in the case of smaller datasets, we need more samples to estimate quality reliably, as data variance is higher.\nGround truth jobs A Ground Truth job (GT job) is a way to represent the validation set in a CVAT task. This job is similar to regular annotation jobs - you can edit the annotations manually, use auto-annotation features, and import annotations in this job. There can be no more than 1 Ground Truth job in a task.\nTo enable quality estimation in a task, you need to create a Ground truth job in the task, annotate it, switch the job stage to acceptance, and set the job state to completed. Once the Ground Truth job is configured, CVAT will start using this job for quality estimation.\nRead more about Ground Truth management here.\nConfiguring quality estimation There are 2 key components related to quality estimation configuration: Ground Truth jobs and Quality settings. Ground Truth jobs are configured at the Task level. In this section, we explain how to set up a Ground Truth job. Read more about quality settings here.\nNote A Ground truth job is considered configured if it is at the acceptance stage and in the completed state. A configured Ground Truth job is required for all quality computations in CVAT.\nIn a new task In an existing task Go to the task creation page Configure basic and advanced parameters according to your requirements, and attach a dataset to be annotated Scroll down to the Quality Control section below Select one of the validation modes available Create the task and open the task page Upload or create Ground Truth annotations in the Ground Truth job in the task Switch the Ground Truth job into the acceptance stage and completed state Note For already existing tasks only the Ground Truth validation mode is available. If you want to use Honeypots for your task, you will need to recreate the task.\nOpen the task page Click +. In the Add new job window, fill in the following fields: Job type: Use the default parameter Ground truth. Frame selection method: Use the default parameter Random. Quantity %: Set the desired percentage of frames for the Ground truth job. Note that when you use Quantity %, the Frames field will be autofilled. Frame count: Set the desired number of frames for the Ground truth job. Note that when you use Frames, the Quantity % field will be autofilled. Seed: (Optional) If you need to make the random selection reproducible, specify this number. It can be any integer number, the same value will yield the same random selection (given that the frame number is unchanged). Note that if you want to use a custom frame sequence, you can do this using the server API instead, Click Submit. The Ground truth job will appear in the jobs list.\nAnnotate frames and save your work or upload annotations. Switch the Ground Truth job into the acceptance stage and completed state Validation modes Currently, there are 2 validation modes available for tasks: Ground Truth and Honeypots. These names are often used interchangeably, but in CVAT they have some differences. Both modes rely on the use of Ground Truth annotations in a task, stored in a Ground Truth job, where they can be managed.\nGround Truth In this mode some of the task frames are selected into the validation set, represented as a separate Ground Truth job. The regular annotation jobs in the task are not affected in any way.\nGround Truth jobs can be created at the task creation automatically or manually at any moment later. They can also be removed manually at any moment. This validation mode is available for any tasks and annotations.\nThis is a flexible mode that can be enabled or disabled at any moment without any disruptions to the annotation process.\nFrame selection This validation mode can use several frame selection methods.\nRandom This is a simple method that selects frames into the validation set randomly, representing the basic approach, described above.\nParameters:\nframe count - the number or percent of the task frames to be used for validation. Can be specified as an absolute number in the Frame count field or a percent in the Quantity field. If there are both fields on the page, they are linked, which means changing one of them will adjust the other one automatically. random seed - a number to be used to initialize the random number generator. Can be useful if you want to create a reproducible sequence of frames. Random per job This method selects frames into the validation set randomly from each annotation job in the task.\nIt solves one of the issues with the simple Random method that some of the jobs can get no validation frames, which makes it impossible to estimate quality in such jobs. Note that using this method can result in increased total size of the validation set.\nParameters:\nframe count per job - the percent of the job frames to be used for validation. This method uses segment size of the task to select the same number of validation frames in each job, if possible. Can be specified as an absolute number in the Frame count field or a percent in the Quantity per job field. If there are both fields on the page, they are linked, which means changing one of them will adjust the other one automatically. random seed - a number to be used to initialize the random number generator. Can be useful if you want to create a reproducible sequence of frames. Honeypots In this mode some random frames of the task are selected into the validation set. Then, validation frames are randomly mixed into regular annotation jobs. This mode can also be called “Ground Truth pool”, reflecting the way validation frames are used. This mode can only be used at task creation and cannot be changed later.\nThe mode has some limitations on the compatible tasks:\nIt’s not possible to use it for an already existing task, the task has to be recreated. This mode assumes random frame ordering, so it is only available for image annotation tasks and not for ordered sequences like videos. Tracks are not supported in such tasks. The validation set can be managed after the task is created - annotations can be edited, frames can be excluded and restored, and honeypot frames in the regular jobs can be changed. However, it’s not possible to select new validation frames after the task is created. The Ground truth job created for this validation mode cannot be deleted.\nParameters:\nframe count per job (%) - the percent of job frames (segment size) to be added into each annotation job from the validation set. Can be specified in the Overhead per job field. total frame count (%) - the percent of the task frames to be included into the validation set. This value must result in at least frame count per job * segment size frames. Can be specified in the Total honeypots field. Mode summary Here is a brief comparison of the validation modes:\nAspect Ground Truth Honeypots When can be used any time at task creation only Frame management options exclude, restore exclude, restore, change honeypots in jobs Ground Truth job management options create, delete create Task frame requirements - random ordering only Annotations any tracks are not supported Minimum validation frames count - manual and random_uniform - any (but some jobs can get no validation frames)- random_per_job - jobs count * GT frames per job not less than honeypots count per job Task annotation import GT annotations and regular annotations do not affect each other Annotations are imported both into the GT job and regular jobs. Annotations for validation frames are copied into corresponding honeypot frames. Task annotation export GT annotations and regular annotations do not affect each other Annotations for non-validation frames are exported as is. Annotations for validation frames are taken from the GT frames. Honeypot frames are skipped. Choosing the right mode Here are some examples on how to choose between these options. The general advice is to use Ground Truth for better flexibility, but keep in mind that it can require more resources for validation set annotation. Honeypots, on the other hand, can be beneficial if you want to minimize the number of validation images required, but the downside here is that there are some limitations on where this mode can be used.\nExample: a video annotation with tracks. In this case there is only 1 option - the Ground Truth mode, so just use it.\nExample: an image dataset annotation, image order is not important. Here you can use both options. You can choose Ground Truth for better flexibility in validation. This way, you will have the full control of validation frames in the task, annotation options won’t be limited, and the regular jobs will not be affected in any way. However, if you have a limited budget for the validation (for instance, you have only a small number of validation frames) or you want to allow more scalability (with this approach the number of validation frames doesn’t depend on the number of regular annotation jobs), it makes sense to consider using Honeypots instead.\nQuality management If a task has a validation configured, there are several options to manage validation set images. With any of the validation modes, there will be a special Ground Truth (GT) job in the task.\nValidation set management Validation frames can be managed on the task Quality Management page. Here it’s possible to check the number of validation frames, current validation mode and review the frame details. For each frame you can see the number of uses in the task. When in the Ground Truth mode, this number will be 1 for all frames. With Honeypots, these numbers can be 0, 1 or more.\nFrame changes In both validation modes it’s possible to exclude some of the validation frames from being used for validation. This can be useful if you find that some of the validation frames are “bad”, extra, or if they have incorrect annotations, which you don’t want to fix. Once a frame is marked “excluded”, it will not be used for validation. There is also an option to restore a previously excluded frame if you decide so.\nThere is an option to exclude or restore frames in bulk mode. To use it, select the frames needed using checkboxes, and click one of the buttons next to the table header.\nGround Truth job management In the Ground Truth validation mode, there will be an option to remove the Ground Truth job from the task. It can be useful if you want to change validation set frames completely, add more frames, or remove some of the frames for any reason. This is available in the job Actions menu.\nIn the Honeypots mode, it’s not possible to add or remove the GT job, so it’s not possible to add more validation frames.\nCreate A Ground Truth job can be added manually in a task without a selected validation mode or in a task with the Ground Truth validation mode, after the existing Ground Truth job is deleted manually.\nDelete To delete the Ground Truth job, do the following:\nOpen the task and find the Ground Truth job in the jobs list. Click on three dots to open the menu. From the menu, select Delete. Note The Ground truth job in the “Honeypots” task validation mode cannot be deleted. Import annotations If you want to import annotations into the Ground truth job, do the following:\nOpen the task and find the Ground truth job in the jobs list. Click on three dots to open the menu. From the menu, select Import annotations. Select import format and select file. Click OK. Note If there are imported annotations for the frames that exist in the task, but are not included in the Ground truth job, they will be ignored. This way, you don’t need to worry about “cleaning up” your Ground truth annotations for the whole dataset before importing them. Importing annotations for the frames that are not known in the task still raises errors. Export annotations To export annotations from the Ground Truth job, do the following:\nOpen the task and find a job in the jobs list. Click on three dots to open the menu. From the menu, select Export annotations. Annotation management Annotations for validation frames can be displayed and edited in a special Ground Truth job in the task. You can edit the annotations manually, use auto-annotation features, import and export annotations in this job.\nIn the Ground Truth task validation mode, annotations of the ground Truth job do not affect other jobs in any way. The Ground Truth job is just a separate job, which can only be changed directly. Annotations from Ground truth jobs are not included in the dataset export, they also cannot be imported during task annotations import or with automatic annotation for the task.\nIn the Honeypots task validation mode, the annotations of the GT job also do not affect other jobs in any way. However, import and export of task annotations works differently. When importing task annotations, annotations for validation frames will be copied both into GT job frames and into corresponding honeypot frames in annotation jobs. When exporting task annotations, honeypot frames in annotation jobs will be ignored, and validation frames in the resulting dataset will get annotations from the GT job.\nNote That it means that exporting from a task with honeypots and importing the results back will result in changed annotations on the honeypot frames. If you want to backup annotations, use a task backup or export job annotations instead. Import and export of Ground Truth job annotations works the same way in both modes.\nGround Truth jobs are included in task backups, so can be saved and restored this way.\nImport, Export, and Delete options are available from the Ground Truth job Actions menu. Read more.\nAnnotation quality settings Quality settings provide options to tweak some aspects of annotation comparisons and quality estimation in general. For instance, you can configure which annotation overlap should be considered good enough or how specific annotation types must be compared.\nQuality settings can be set up at the Task or the Project level. If a task is not bound to a project, it uses its own quality settings. Tasks inside a project can use individual quality settings or inherit settings from the project they belong to. Read more about quality settings in projects here.\nTo set up quality settings, open the Quality Settings tab on the Quality Control page for a task or project, available in the Actions menu.\nThere is a number of parameters available for configuration. Hover the mouse over a ? mark to display a description for a setting.\nAfter the settings are updated, remember to save the values using the Save button. The updated settings will take effect on the next quality update.\nAnnotation quality settings have the following parameters:\nParameter Description General reporting Target metric The primary metric used for quality estimation. It affects which metric is displayed in the UI and used for overall quality estimation. Job selection filter The filter for the jobs included in quality computation. Only jobs matching the filter criteria will be included in the quality results. Immediate feedback Max validations per job Configures maximum job validations per assignment for the Immediate feedback feature. Target metric threshold Defines the minimal quality requirements in terms of the selected target metric. Serves as an acceptance threshold for the Immediate feedback feature. Shape matching Min overlap threshold Min overlap threshold used for the distinction between matched and unmatched shapes. Used to match all types of annotations. It corresponds to the Intersection over union (IoU) for spatial annotations, such as bounding boxes and masks. Low overlap threshold Low overlap threshold used for the distinction between strong and weak matches. Only affects Low overlap warnings. It’s supposed that Min similarity threshold \u003c= Low overlap threshold. Empty frames are annotated Consider frames annotated as “empty” if there are no annotations on a frame. If a frame is empty in both GT and job annotations, it will be considered a matching annotation. Point and Skeleton matching OKS Sigma Relative size of points. The percent of the bbox side, used as the radius of the circle around the GT point, where the checked point is expected to be. For boxes with different width and height, the “side” is computed as a geometric mean of the width and height. Point matching Point size base When comparing point annotations (including both separate points and point groups), the OKS sigma parameter defines a matching area for each GT point based on the object size. The point size base parameter allows configuring how to determine the object size. If set to image_size, the image size is used. Useful if each point annotation represents a separate object or boxes grouped with points do not represent object boundaries. If set to group_bbox_size, the object size is based on the point group bounding box size. Useful if each point group represents an object or there is a bbox grouped with points, representing the object size. Polyline matching Relative thickness Thickness of polylines, relative to the (image area) ^ 0.5. The distance to the boundary around the GT line inside of which the checked line points should be. Check orientation Indicates that polylines have direction. Used to produce Mismatching direction warnings Min similarity gain (%) The minimal gain in IoU between the given and reversed line directions to consider the line inverted. Only useful with the Check orientation parameter. Group matching Compare groups Enables or disables annotation group checks. This check will produce Group mismatch warnings for grouped annotations, if the annotation groups do not match with the specified threshold. Each annotation within a group is expected to match with a corresponding annotation in a GT group. Min group match threshold Minimal IoU for groups to be considered matching, used when Compare groups is enabled. Mask and polygon matching Check object visibility Check for partially-covered annotations. Masks and polygons will be compared to each other. Min visibility threshold Minimal visible area percent of the mask annotations (polygons, masks). Used for reporting Covered annotation warnings, useful with the Check object visibility option. Match only visible parts Use only the visible part of the masks and polygons in comparisons. Project quality settings In CVAT, it is possible to group tasks into projects to share common configurations or establish a logical grouping for datasets. In this section, we explain options for quality management inside projects.\nWhen tasks are inside a project, it can be convenient to reuse the same quality setup for all the project tasks. There is an option to use quality settings from the parent project for all or only for specific tasks inside a project. This is controlled by the corresponding toggle on the Quality control page of the task:\nIf some of the project tasks have individual settings, a notification is displayed on the project settings page. You can enforce project settings for all the project tasks by clicking the Force project settings button.\nBy default, new tasks inside a project inherit the quality settings of the project. You can freely switch between these 2 modes without losing the individual configuration for the task.\nUpdating project quality includes quality computation for all the nested tasks. If the task quality is updated in a specific task manually, project quality has to be recomputed to display relevant values.\nJob filtering Depending on the situation, you may need or don’t need to include specific jobs in the quality report. For example, your workflow may require quality checks only for completed jobs or maybe you want to exclude jobs from a specific task from a project quality report. There is an option to filter which jobs are included in quality computations. You can configure this by changing the Job selection filter in quality settings. Only jobs matching the filter criteria will be included in the quality results. If a filter is changed, quality must be recomputed for the filter to take effect.\nComparisons Tags The equality is used for matching.\nShapes A pair of shapes is considered matching, if both their shapes and labels match. For each shape, spatial parameters are matched first, then labels are matched.\nEach shape type can have their own spatial matching details. Specifically:\nbounding box - IoU (including rotation). For example, for a pair of bounding boxes it can be visualized this way:\nIoU = intersection area / union area. The green part is the intersection, and green, yellow and red ones together are the union.\npolygons, masks - IoU. Polygons and masks are considered interchangeable, which means a mask can be matched with a polygon and vice versa. Polygons and masks in groups are merged into a single object first. If the Match only visible parts option is enabled, objects will be cut to only the visible (non-covered) parts only, which is determined by the shape z order.\nskeletons - The OKS metric from the COCO dataset is used. Briefly, each skeleton point gets a circular area around, determined by the object size (bounding box side) and relative point size (sigma) values, where this point can be matched with the specified probability. If a bounding box is grouped with the skeleton, it is used for object size computation, otherwise a bounding box of visible points of the skeleton is used.\nFor example, consider a skeleton with 6 points and a square bounding box attached:\nIn this example, the Sigma parameter is 0.05 (5%) of the bbox side. Areas shown in the green color cover ~68.2% (1 sigma) of the points, corresponding to each GT point. A point on the boundary of such an area will have ~88% of probability to be correct. The blue-colored zone contains ~95% (2 sigma) of the correct points for the corresponding GT point. A point on the boundary of such an area will have ~60% of probability to be correct. These probabilities are then averaged over the visible points of the skeleton, and the resulting values are compared against the Min similarity threshold to determine whether the skeletons are matching. Sigma corresponds to one from the normal distribution.\npoints - The OKS metric is used for each point group annotation. Same as for skeletons, OKS Sigma determines relative point sizes. The Point size base setting allows configuring whether points in point groups should use the group bounding box or the image space. Using image space for object size can be useful if you want to treat each point as a separate annotation.\npolylines - A pair of lines is considered matching if all the points of one line lie within a “hull” of the other one. The “hull” is determined as the area around the polyline, such as if the line had some “thickness”. For example, the black polyline can have a hull shown in the green color:\nThe line thickness can be configured via the Relative thickness setting. The value is relative to the image side and determines a half of the hull width.\nellipses - IoU, described in more detail above.\nNote 2D cuboids are not supported. Tracks Tracks are split into separate shapes and compared on the per-frame basis with other tracks and shapes.\nQuality Analytics Once the quality estimation is enabled in a task and the Ground Truth job is configured, quality analytics becomes available for the task and its jobs.\nWhen you open the Quality Analytics page, it displays quality metrics from the most recent quality estimation. If it’s your first time accessing the page, no quality report will be available yet. The date of the last computation is shown next to the report download button.\nIf you want to request updating of quality metrics in a task (e.g. after the settings were changed), you can do this by pressing the Refresh button on the task Quality Management \u003e Analytics page.\nNote The process of quality calculation may take up to several hours, depending on the amount of data and labeled objects, and is not updated immediately after task updates. Once quality metrics are computed, they are available for detailed review on this page. Conflicts can be reviewed in the Review mode of jobs. A job must have at least 1 validation frame (shown in the Frame intersection column) to be included in quality computation.\nAnalytics page contents The Analytics page has the following elements:\nField Description Mean annotation quality Displays the average quality of annotations, which includes: counts of the accurate annotations, total task annotations, ground truth annotations, accuracy, precision, and recall. The currently selected Target metric is displayed as the primary score. GT Conflicts Conflicts identified during quality assessment, including extra or missing annotations. Mouse over the ? icon for a detailed conflict report on your dataset. Issues Number of opened issues. If no issues were reported, 0 will be shown. Quality report Quality report in JSON format. Ground truth job data Information about ground truth job, including date, time, and number of issues. List of jobs List of all the jobs in the task Problem Reporting CVAT reports 2 possible error types: errors and warnings. Errors affect the resulting quality scores and highlight significant problems in annotations. Warnings do not affect the resulting quality metrics, but they still can highlight significant problems, depending on the project requirements.\nProblem Type Description Missing annotation error No matching annotation found in the regular job annotations. Configured by Min overlap threshold and shape type-specific parameters. Extra annotation error No matching annotation found in the GT job annotations. Configured by Min overlap threshold and shape type-specific parameters. Mismatching label error A GT and a regular job annotations match, but their labels are different. Low overlap warning A GT and a regular job annotations match, but the similarity is low. Configured by Low overlap threshold. Mismatching direction warning A GT and a regular lines match, but the lines have different direction. Configured by Compare orientation. Mismatching attributes warning A GT and a regular annotations match, but their attributes are different. Configured by Compare attributes. Mismatching groups warning A GT and a regular annotation groups do not match. Configured by Compare groups. Covered annotation warning The visible part of a regular mask or polygon annotation is too small. The visibility is determined by arranging mask and polygon shapes on the frame in the specified z order. Configured by Check object visibility. Quality Reports For each job included in quality computation there is a quality report downloading button on the Analytics page. There is also a button to download the aggregated task quality report. These buttons provide an option to download a Quality Report for a task or job in JSON format. Such reports can be useful if you want to process quality reported by CVAT automatically in your scripts etc.\nQuality Reports contain quality metrics and conflicts, and include all the information available on the quality analytics page. You can find additional quality metrics in these reports, such as mean_iou for shapes, confusion matrices, per-label and per-frame quality estimations.\nAdditional information on how to compute and use various metrics for dataset quality estimation is available here.\nReviewing GT conflicts To see GT Conflicts in the CVAT interface, go to Review \u003e Issues \u003e Show ground truth annotations and conflicts.\nGround Truth annotations are displayed with a dotted-line border. The associated label and the (Ground Truth) marker are shown on hovering.\nUpon hovering over an issue on the right-side panel with your mouse, the corresponding annotations are highlighted.\nUse arrows in the Issue toolbar to move between GT conflicts.\nTo create an issue related to the conflict, right-click on the bounding box and from the menu select the type of issue you want to create.\nAnnotation quality \u0026 Honeypot video tutorial This video demonstrates the process:\n","categories":"","description":"Guidelines for assessing annotation quality in CVAT automatically","excerpt":"Guidelines for assessing annotation quality in CVAT automatically","ref":"/docs/qa-analytics/auto-qa/","tags":"","title":"Automated QA, Review \u0026 Honeypots"},{"body":"Contextual images (or related images) are additional images that provide context or additional information related to the primary image.\nUse them to add extra contextual about the object to improve the accuracy of annotation.\nContextual images are available for 2D and 3D tasks.\nSee:\nFolder structure Contextual images Folder structure To add contextual images to the task, you need to organize the images folder into one of the supported file layouts.

It encapsulates session and connection logic, manages headers and cookies, and provides access to various APIs.\nTo create an instance of ApiClient, you need to set up a cvat_sdk.api_client.Configuration object and pass it to the ApiClient class constructor. Additional connection-specific options, such as extra headers and cookies can be specified in the class constructor. ApiClient implements the context manager protocol. Typically, you create ApiClient this way:\nfrom cvat_sdk.api_client import ApiClient, Configuration configuration = Configuration(host=\"http://localhost\") with ApiClient(configuration) as api_client: ... After creating an ApiClient instance, you can send requests to various server endpoints via *_api member properties and directly, using the rest_client member. Read more about API wrappers below.\nTypically, the first thing you do with ApiClient is log in. Read more about authentication options below.\nAuthentication CVAT supports 3 authentication options:\nPersonal Access Token (PAT) authentication, with an access token value Basic authentication, with a username and a password Session authentication, with a session ID and a CSRF token Legacy token authentication, with an API key (deprecated) Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication requires a token that can be configured in the user settings section in the UI. It is the recommended authentication option for most API clients. Read more.\nBasic authentication requires a username and password pair. For better security it’s recommended to use other authentication options instead.\nSession authentication requires a session ID and a CSRF token, which can be obtained after logging in via the /api/auth/login endpoint using the basic authentication credentials.\nLegacy token authentication (deprecated) requires an API key, which can be obtained after logging in via the /api/auth/login endpoint using the basic authentication credentials.\nAuthentication credentials for an ApiClient instance can be specified in a Configuration object:\nPersonal Access Token (PAT) authentication Basic authentication Session authentication Legacy token authentication (deprecated) configuration = Configuration( access_token=\"\u003ctoken value\u003e\", ... ) with ApiClient(configuration) as api_client: ... configuration = Configuration( username=\"YOUR_USERNAME\", password=\"YOUR_PASSWORD\", ... ) with ApiClient(configuration) as api_client: ... configuration = Configuration( api_key={ \"sessionAuth\": \"\u003csessionid cookie value\u003e\", \"csrfAuth\": \"\u003ccsrftoken cookie value\u003e\", }, ... ) with ApiClient(configuration) as api_client: ...

Then, the authentication keys can be set in the ApiClient instance.\nSession authentication Legacy token authentication (deprecated) from cvat_sdk.api_client import models (auth, _) = api_client.auth_api.create_login( models.LoginSerializerExRequest(username=\"username\", password=\"password\") ) # Set up required headers assert \"sessionid\" in api_client.cookies # managed by ApiClient automatically api_client.set_default_header(\"X-CSRFToken\", api_client.cookies[\"csrftoken\"].value) api_client.set_default_header(\"Origin\", api_client.build_origin_header()) Warning This authentication option is deprecated and will be removed in future. from cvat_sdk.api_client import models (auth, _) = api_client.auth_api.create_login( models.LoginSerializerExRequest(username=\"username\", password=\"password\") ) api_client.set_default_header(\"Authorization\", \"Token \" + auth.key) API wrappers API endpoints are grouped by tags into separate classes in the cvat_sdk.api_client.apis package.\nAPIs can be accessed as ApiClient object members:\napi_client.auth_api.\u003coperation\u003e(...) api_client.tasks_api.\u003coperation\u003e(...) And APIs can be instantiated directly like this:\nfrom cvat_sdk.api_client import ApiClient, apis api_client = ApiClient(...) auth_api = apis.AuthApi(api_client) auth_api.\u003coperation\u003e(...) tasks_api = apis.TasksApi(api_client) tasks_api.\u003coperation\u003e(...) For each operation, the API wrapper class has a corresponding \u003coperation\u003e_endpoint member. This member represents the endpoint as a first-class object, which provides metainformation about the endpoint, such as the relative URL of the endpoint, parameter names, types and their placement in the request. It also allows to pass the operation to other functions and invoke it from there.\nFor a typical server entity like Task, Project, Job etc., the *Api classes provide methods that reflect Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) operations: create, retrieve, list, update, partial_update, delete. The set of available operations depends on the entity type.\nYou can find the list of the available APIs and their documentation here.\nModels Requests and responses can include data. It can be represented as plain Python data structures and model classes (or models). In CVAT API, model for requests and responses are separated: the request models have the Request suffix in the name, while the response models have no suffix. Models can be found in the cvat_sdk.api_client.models package.\nModels can be instantiated like this:\nfrom cvat_sdk.api_client import models user_model = models.User(...) Model parameters can be passed as models, or as plain Python data structures. This rule applies recursively, starting from the method parameters. In particular, this means you can pass a dict into a method or into a model constructor, and corresponding fields will be parsed from this data automatically:\ntask_spec = models.TaskWriteRequest( name='example task', labels=[ models.PatchedLabelRequest( name=\"car\", color=\"#ff00ff\", attributes=[ model.AttributeRequest( name=\"a\", mutable=True, input_type=\"number\", default_value=\"5\", values=[\"4\", \"5\", \"6\"] ) ] ) ], ) api_client.tasks_api.create(task_spec) Is equivalent to:\napi_client.tasks_api.create({ 'name': 'example task', \"labels\": [{ \"name\": \"car\", \"color\": \"#ff00ff\", \"attributes\": [ { \"name\": \"a\", \"mutable\": True, \"input_type\": \"number\", \"default_value\": \"5\", \"values\": [\"4\", \"5\", \"6\"] } ] }], }) You can mix these variants.\nMost models provide corresponding interface classes called like I\u003cmodel name\u003e. They can be used to implement your own classes or describe APIs. They just provide type annotations and descriptions for model fields.\nYou can export model values to plain Python dicts using the to_dict() method and the cvat_sdk.api_client.model_utils.to_json() function.\nYou can find the list of the available models and their documentation here.\nSending requests To send a request to a server endpoint, you need to obtain an instance of the corresponding *Api class. You can find summary about available API classes and supported endpoints here. The *Api instance object allows to send requests to the relevant server endpoints.\nBy default, all operations return 2 objects: the parsed response data and the response itself.\nThe first returned value is a model parsed from the response data. If a method does not have any return value, None is always returned as the first value. You can control automatic parsing using the _parse_response method kwarg. When disabled, None is returned.\nThe second value is the raw response, which can be useful to get response parameters, such as status code, headers, or raw response data. By default, the status code of the response is checked to be positive. In the case of request failure, an exception is raised by default. This behavior can be controlled by the _check_status method kwarg. If the status is not checked, you will need to manually check the response status code and perform actions needed.\nA typical endpoint call looks like this:\nfrom cvat_sdk.api_client import ApiClient, apis with ApiClient(...) as api_client: ... (data, response) = api_client.tasks_api.list() # process the response ... Operation parameters can be passed as positional or keyword arguments. API methods provide extra common arguments which control invocation logic:\n_parse_response (bool) - Allows to enable and disable response data parsing. When enabled, the response data is parsed into a model or a basic type and returned as the first value. When disabled, the response is not parsed, and None is returned. Can be useful, for instance, if you need to parse data manually, or if you expect an error in the response. Default is True. _check_status (bool) - Allows to enable or disable response status checks. When enabled, the response status code is checked to be positive as defined in the HTTP standards. In the case of negative status, an exception is raised. Default is True. _validate_inputs (bool): specifies if type checking should be done on the data sent to the server. Default is True. _validate_outputs (bool): specifies if type checking should be done on the data received from the server. Default is True. _request_timeout (None | int | float | Tuple[int | float, int | float]) - Allows to control timeouts. If one number is provided, it will be the total request timeout. It can also be a tuple with (connection, read) timeouts. Default is None, which means no timeout. _content_type (None | str) - Allows to specify the Content-Type header value for the request. Endpoints can support different content types and behave differently depending on the value. For file uploads _content_type=\"multipart/form-data\" must be specified. Read more about file uploads here. Default is application/json. Note The API is autogenerated. In some cases the server API schema may be incomplete or underspecified. Please report to us all the problems found. A typical problem is that a response data can’t be parsed automatically due to the incorrect schema. In this case, the simplest workaround is to disable response parsing using the _parse_response=False method argument. You can find many examples of API client usage in REST API tests here.\nOrganizations To create resource in the context of an organization, use one of these method arguments:\norg - The unique organization slug org_id- The organization id ... (task, response) = api_client.tasks_api.create(task_spec, org_id=org_id) Paginated responses There are several endpoints that allow to request multiple server entities. Typically, these endpoints are called list_.... When there are lots of data, the responses can be paginated to reduce server load. If an endpoint returns paginated data, a single page is returned per request. In some cases all entries need to be retrieved. CVAT doesn’t provide specific API or parameters for this, so the solution is to write a loop to collect and join data from multiple requests. SDK provides an utility function for this at cvat_sdk.core.helpers.get_paginated_collection().\nExample:\nfrom cvat_sdk.core.helpers import get_paginated_collection ... project_tasks = get_paginated_collection( api_client.projects_api.list_tasks_endpoint, id=project_id, ) Binary data in requests and responses At the moment, sending and receiving binary data - such as files - can be difficult via the low-level SDK API. Please use the following recommendations.\nSending data By default, requests use the application/json content type, which is a text type. However, it’s inefficient to send binary data in this encoding, and the data passed won’t be converted automatically. If you need to send files or other binary data, please specify _content_type=\"multipart/form-data\" in the request parameters:\nExample:\n(result, response) = api_client.tasks_api.create_data( id=42, data_request=models.DataRequest( client_files=[ open(\"image.jpg\", 'rb') ], image_quality=70, ), _content_type=\"multipart/form-data\", # required ) Please also note that if there are complex fields in the data (such as nested lists or dicts), they, in turn, cannot be encoded as multipart/form-data, so the recommended solution is to split fields into files and others, and send them in different requests with different content types:\nExample:\ndata = { 'client_files': [...], # a list of binary files 'image_quality': ..., # a simple type - int 'job_file_mapping': [...], # a complex type - list } # Initialize uploading api_client.tasks_api.create_data( id=42, data_request=models.DataRequest(image_quality=data[\"image_quality\"]), upload_start=True, ) # Upload binary data api_client.tasks_api.create_data( id=42, data_request=models.DataRequest( client_files=data.pop(\"client_files\"), image_quality=data[\"image_quality\"], ), upload_multiple=True, _content_type=\"multipart/form-data\", ) # Finalize the uploading and send the remaining fields api_client.tasks_api.create_data( id=42, data_request=models.DataRequest(**data), upload_finish=True, ) Receiving data Receiving binary files can also be difficult with the low-level API. To avoid unexpected behavior, it is recommended to specify _parse_response=False in the request parameters. In this case, SDK will not try to parse models from responses, and the response data can be fetched directly from the response:\nimport json from http import HTTPStatus from time import sleep from urllib.parse import parse_qsl, urlparse from cvat_sdk.api_client import ApiClient, Configuration, models interval = 1 with ApiClient( configuration=Configuration(host=\"\u003ccvat_host\u003e\", username=\"\u003cusername\u003e\", password=\"\u003cpassword\u003e\") ) as api_client: # Initiate the process to export a task as a dataset (_, response) = api_client.tasks_api.create_dataset_export( id=task_id, format=\"COCO 1.0\", save_images=True, _parse_response=False, ) assert response.status == HTTPStatus.ACCEPTED # Obtain the background request ID from the server response rq_id = json.loads(response.data).get(\"rq_id\") assert rq_id, \"The rq_id parameter was not found in the server response\" # Check the status of the background process while True: (background_request, response) = api_client.requests_api.retrieve(rq_id) assert response.status == HTTPStatus.OK process_status = background_request.status.value if process_status in ( models.RequestStatus.allowed_values[(\"value\",)][\"FINISHED\"], models.RequestStatus.allowed_values[(\"value\",)][\"FAILED\"], ): break sleep(interval) if process_status != models.RequestStatus.allowed_values[(\"value\",)][\"FINISHED\"]: exception_msg = f\"Export failed with status: {process_status}\" if background_request.message: exception_msg += f\". Details: {background_request.message}\" assert False, exception_msg # Download a prepared file result_url = background_request.result_url assert result_url, \"No 'result_url' in the server response\" parsed_result_url = urlparse(result_url) query_params = parse_qsl(parsed_result_url.query) _, response = api_client.call_api( parsed_result_url.path, method=\"GET\", query_params=query_params, auth_settings=api_client.configuration.auth_settings(), _parse_response=False, ) # Save the resulting file with open(\"output_file.zip\", \"wb\") as output_file: while (chunk := response.read(8192)): output_file.write(chunk) Different versions of API endpoints The cloudstorages/id/content REST API endpoint Warning The retrieve_content method of cloudstorages_api will be deprecated in 2.5.0 version. We recommend using retrieve_content_v2 method that matches to revised API when using SDK. For backward compatibility, we continue to support the prior interface version until version 2.6.0 is released. Here you can find the example how to get the bucket content using new method retrieve_content_v2.\nfrom pprint import pprint from cvat_sdk.api_client import ApiClient, Configuration next_token = None files, prefixes = [], [] prefix = \"\" with ApiClient( configuration=Configuration(host=BASE_URL, username=user, password=password) ) as api_client: while True: data, response = api_client.cloudstorages_api.retrieve_content_v2( cloud_storage_id, **({\"prefix\": prefix} if prefix else {}), **({\"next_token\": next_token} if next_token else {}), ) # the data will have the following structure: # {'content': [ # {'mime_type': \u003cimage|video|archive|pdf|DIR\u003e, 'name': \u003cname\u003e, 'type': \u003cREG|DIR\u003e}, # ], # 'next': \u003cnext_token_string|None\u003e} files.extend( [ prefix + f[\"name\"] for f in data[\"content\"] if str(f[\"type\"]) == \"REG\" ] ) prefixes.extend( [ prefix + f[\"name\"] for f in data[\"content\"] if str(f[\"type\"]) == \"DIR\" ] ) next_token = data[\"next\"] if next_token: continue if not len(prefixes): break prefix = f\"{prefixes.pop()}/\" pprint(files) # ['sub/image_1.jpg', 'image_2.jpg'] Sending custom requests Sometimes you might need sending a custom request while using the ApiClient. Typically, it’s desirable to make this request using the same configuration and authentication parameters as regular requests sent via the ApiClient instance. One particularly useful example for this is dataset export. When exporting a dataset, you receive a download URL from the server after the file is prepared (see example in receiving data). This URL requires authentication, but it can’t be made via the regular ApiClient endpoint methods.\nThere are several options to make such a custom request via an ApiClient instance:\nuse api_client.call_api() use api_client.request() Alternatively, it’s also possible to make a request using a custom backend for requests, while keeping the existing authentication of the ApiClient.\nUsing api_client.call_api() Using api_client.request() Using a custom backend This option provides higher-level interface and allows better integration with other ApiClient-related interfaces, such as Endpoint.\nfrom urllib.parse import parse_qsl, urlparse with ApiClient(...) as api_client: parsed_url = urlparse(\"\u003ccustom URL\u003e\") query_params = parse_qsl(parsed_url.query) _, response = api_client.call_api( parsed_url.path, method=\"GET\", query_params=query_params, _parse_response=False, ) # process response.data ... This option provides a low-level interface and allows more customization. It can be useful if you need to reuse the existing connection configuration of the ApiClient instance, such as connection pool, timeouts, etc. In order to keep the existing authentication parameters of the ApiClient instance, you can use the functions api_client.get_common_headers() and api_client.update_params_for_auth().\nwith ApiClient(...) as api_client: headers = api_client.get_common_headers() api_client.update_params_for_auth(headers=headers, queries=[], method=\"GET\") response = api_client.request( \"GET\", \"\u003ccustom URL\u003e\", headers=headers, _parse_response=False, ) # process response.data ... It is possible make a custom request using your own backend - for example, using the requests library. In order to keep the existing authentication parameters of the ApiClient instance, you can use the functions api_client.get_common_headers() and api_client.update_params_for_auth().\nimport requests with ApiClient(...) as api_client: headers = api_client.get_common_headers() query_params = [] api_client.update_params_for_auth(headers=headers, queries=query_params, method=\"GET\") response = requests.get(\"\u003ccustom URL\u003e\", params=query_params, headers=headers) # process the response ...

Shortcuts Customization You can customize shortcuts in CVAT settings.\nOpen Settings:\nGo to the Shortcuts tab:\nYou’ll see the shortcuts customization menu:\nAs it can be seen there is a warning, that some shortcuts are reserved by a browser and cannot be overridden in CVAT, there isn’t a specific list available for such combinations, but shortcuts such as ctrl + tab (switching tabs) or ctrl + w (closing tabs) etc, are reserved by the browser and shortcuts such as alt + f4 (closing the window) are usually reserved by your operating system.\nAll sections collapsible, so you can easily navigate through the list of shortcuts. Here is the Global scope expanded:\nTo add a custom shortcut all you have to do is to click the input field and start pressing the sequence you want to assign to the action. As an example f3 has been set here for Show Shortcuts along with f1:\nShortcuts can be any combination of modifiers (ctrl, shift or alt) and up to one non-modifier key e.g. ctrl+shift+f1 etc.\nIf you try to add a shortcut that is already in use, you will get a warning message:\nIf pressed cancel it will remain the same otherwise the conflicting shortcut will be unset.\nIf you want to reset all the shortcuts to default, you can do so by clicking the Restore Defaults button at the top of the shortcut settings.\n","categories":"","description":"List of available keyboard shortcuts and notes about their customization.","excerpt":"List of available keyboard shortcuts and notes about their …","ref":"/docs/getting_started/shortcuts/","tags":"","title":"Shortcuts"},{"body":"The CVAT Single Shape annotation mode accelerates the annotation process and enhances workflow efficiency for specific scenarios.\nBy using this mode you can label objects with a chosen annotation shape and label when an image contains only a single object. By eliminating the necessity to select tools from the sidebar and facilitating quicker navigation between images without the reliance on hotkeys, this feature makes the annotation process significantly faster.\nSee:\nSingle Shape mode annotation interface Annotating in Single Shape mode Query parameters Video tutorial Single Shape mode annotation interface A set of controls in the interface of the Single Shape annotation mode may vary depending on different settings.\nImages below displays the complete interface, featuring all available fields; as mentioned above, certain fields may be absent depending on the scenario.\nFor instance, when annotating with rectangles, the Number of points field will not appear, and if annotating a single class, the Labels selector will be omitted.\nTo access Single Shape mode, open the job, navigate to the top right corner, and from the drop-down menu, select Single Shape.\nThe interface will be different if the shape type was set to Any in the label Constructor:\nThe Single Shape annotation mode has the following fields:\nFeature Explanation Prompt for Shape and Label Displays the selected shape and label for the annotation task, for example: “Annotate cat on the image using rectangle”. Skip Button Enables moving to the next frame without annotating the current one, particularly useful when the frame does not have anything to be annotated. List of Hints Offers guidance on using the interface effectively, including: - Click Skip for frames without required annotations. - Hold the Alt button to avoid unintentional drawing (e.g. when you want only move the image). - Use the Ctrl+Z combination to undo the last action if needed. - Use the Esc button to completely reset the current drawing progress. Label selector Allows for the selection of different labels (cat, or dog in our example) for annotation within the interface. Label type selector A drop-down list to select type of the label (rectangle, ellipse, etc). Only visible when the type of the shape is Any. Options to Enable or Disable Provides configurable options to streamline the annotation process, such as: - Automatically go to the next frame. - Automatically save when finish. - Navigate only empty frames. - Predefined number of points - Specific to polyshape annotations, enabling this option auto-completes a shape once a predefined number of points is reached. Otherwise, pressing N is required to finalize the shape. Number of Points Applicable for polyshape annotations, indicating the number of points to use for image annotation. Annotating in Single Shape mode To annotate in Single Shape mode, follow these steps:\nOpen the job and switch to Single Shape mode. Annotate the image based on the selected shape. For more information on shapes, see Annotation Tools. (Optional) If the image does not contain any objects to annotate, click Skip at the top of the right panel. Submit your work. Query parameters Also, we introduced additional query parameters, which you may append to the job link, to initialize the annotation process and automate workflow:\nQuery Parameter Possible Values Explanation defaultWorkspace Workspace identifier (e.g., single_shape, tags, review, attributes) Specifies the workspace to be used initially, streamlining the setup for different annotation tasks. defaultLabel A string representation of a label (label name) Sets a default label for the annotation session, facilitating consistency across similar tasks. defaultPointsCount Integer - number of points for polyshapes Defines a preset number of points for polyshape annotations, optimizing the annotation process.

One of the easy ways to launch CVAT with the tf-annotation app is to use AWS P3 instances, which provides the NVIDIA GPU. Read more about P3 instances here. Overall setup instruction is explained in main readme file, except Installing Nvidia drivers. So we need to download the drivers and install it. For Amazon P3 instances, download the Nvidia Drivers from Nvidia website. For more check Installing the NVIDIA Driver on Linux Instances link.\nOn Any other AWS Machine: We can follow the same instruction guide mentioned in the installation instructions. The additional step is to add a security group and rule to allow incoming connections.\nFor any of above, don’t forget to set the CVAT_HOST environment variable to the exposed AWS public IP address or hostname:\nexport CVAT_HOST=your-instance.amazonaws.com In case of problems with using hostname, you can also use the public IPV4 instead of hostname. For AWS or any cloud based machines where the instances need to be terminated or stopped, the public IPV4 and hostname changes with every stop and reboot. To address this efficiently, avoid using spot instances that cannot be stopped, since copying the EBS to an AMI and restarting it throws problems. On the other hand, when a regular instance is stopped and restarted, the new hostname/IPV4 can be used to set the CVAT_HOST environment variable.\n","categories":"","description":"Instructions for deploying CVAT on Nvidia GPU and other AWS machines.","excerpt":"Instructions for deploying CVAT on Nvidia GPU and other AWS machines.","ref":"/docs/administration/community/basics/aws-deployment-guide/","tags":"","title":"AWS-Deployment Guide"},{"body":"Overview A simple command line interface for working with CVAT. At the moment it implements a basic feature set but may serve as the starting point for a more comprehensive CVAT administration tool in the future.\nThe following subcommands are supported:\nProjects:\ncreate - create a new project delete - delete projects ls - list all projects Tasks:\ncreate - create a new task create-from-backup - create a task from a backup file delete - delete tasks ls - list all tasks frames - download frames from a task export-dataset - export a task as a dataset import-dataset - import annotations into a task from a dataset backup - back up a task auto-annotate - automatically annotate a task using a local function Functions (Enterprise/Cloud only):\ncreate-native - create a function that can be powered by an agent delete - delete a function run-agent - process requests for a native function Installation To install an official release of CVAT CLI, use this command:\npip install cvat-cli We support Python versions 3.10 and higher.\nUsage The general form of a CLI command is:\n$ cvat-cli \u003ccommon options\u003e \u003cresource\u003e \u003caction\u003e \u003coptions\u003e where:\n\u003ccommon options\u003e are options shared between all subcommands; \u003cresource\u003e is a CVAT resource, such as task; \u003caction\u003e is the action to do with the resource, such as create; \u003coptions\u003e is any options specific to a particular resource and action. You can list available subcommands and options using the --help option:\n$ cvat-cli --help # get help on available common options and resources $ cvat-cli \u003cresource\u003e --help # get help on actions for the given resource $ cvat-cli \u003cresource\u003e \u003caction\u003e --help # get help on action-specific options The CLI implements alias subcommands for some task actions, so that, for example, cvat-cli ls works the same way as cvat-cli task ls.

It is the recommended authentication option for most clients. Read more.\nPassword authentication requires a username and password pair. For better security it’s recommended to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead, if possible.\nPersonal Access Token (PAT) authentication Password authentication A Personal Access Token can only be used via the CVAT_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable. This variable is prioritized over other environment variables used for authentication.\nexport CVAT_ACCESS_TOKEN=\"token value\" cvat-cli task ls Credentials can be specified via the --auth global CLI parameter. The password can be passed after the colon (:) separator or via the PASS environment variable. For better security, it’s recommended to use the PASS environment variable or Personal Access Tokens.\ncvat-cli --auth \"username:password\" task ls export PASS=\"password\" cvat-cli --auth \"username\" task ls The --auth parameter can also be omitted. In this case, the CLI will try to use the current OS user as the username. If the PASS environment variable is configured, it’s value will be used for the password. Otherwise, the password will be requested for input.\ncvat-cli task ls Examples - tasks Create Description of the options you can find in Creating an annotation task section.\nFor create a task you

As a Python module implementing a factory function named create. This function must return an object implementing the AA function protocol. Any parameters specified on the command line using the -p option will be passed to create.\nFor example:\nimport cvat_sdk.auto_annotation as cvataa class _MyFunction: def __init__(...): ... spec = cvataa.DetectionFunctionSpec(...) def detect(context, image): ... def create(...) -\u003e cvataa.DetectionFunction: return _MyFunction(...)

It supports all annotation types except cuboids. Note Consensus merging is currently available only for tasks and jobs. Projects are not supported. CVAT has the following features related to consensus-based annotation:\nCreation of consensus replica jobs for regular annotation jobs in a task Automatic merging for annotations inside consensus replica jobs Basics If you want to improve the quality of your annotations, there are several widespread ways to achieve this. One of the methods is called consensus-based annotation or just consensus. In this method, the same data is annotated several times. Once there are several different annotations (“opinions”) for the same objects, they can be merged in order to obtain annotations of higher quality.\nLet’s consider an explanatory example. Imagine there is a group of people and you want to learn whether something is true or not from them. To accomplish this, you decided to ask everyone and pick the most popular answer in the end. With such an idea, you can get many possible combinations of votes, including unanimous ones. This strategy is called majority voting - and it requires such a majority to exist. If there is an even number of votes for both options, you don’t have enough information to prefer one of the options to the other, so, in general, it’s desirable to have an odd number of people in the group. With larger groups the method becomes less sensitive to this requirement, as when the voters are independent and the question is meaningful, the answers are less likely to separate evenly between the possible options. This method can also be used if the question has more than 2 possible answers. In this case, there are more possible distributions of the votes, but the same logic can be applied.\nReturning back to datasets, consensus annotation works very similar to the example above. Each image is annotated several times, typically by different persons, then the resulting annotations are compared between each other and merged, using majority voting or a different strategy. The key advantage of consensus annotation is that it helps to reduce personal annotator bias in annotation. This improves the quality of annotation by filtering out errors, noise (variance) and outliers in the annotation, leaving only the most representative ones.\nDatasets, typically, have a large number of images and objects. This method of annotation requires several different annotations for the whole dataset, so it is expected to have several times of the annotation costs compared to the simple single-annotation approach. Depending on the annotation resources available, budget, and requirements, consensus annotation may or may not be feasible in a particular task.\nOne application for this approach that can be recommended is Ground Truth annotation. This type of annotation typically requires especially high quality annotations, because it is used to validate model or annotator answers. Ground Truth is typically limited only to a small portion of the whole dataset images, for example 3%. If a 3- or 5-fold consensus is applied to GT annotations, it is possible to obtain more reliable GT annotations for 10-15% of the full dataset annotation cost. Once there is such a reliable GT dataset, it can be used for annotator validation, on the remaining dataset ensuring the quality metrics are representative and objective.\nConsensus replica jobs A Consensus Replica job (replica) is the way to represent one of the annotator “opinions” in CVAT. Consensus replicas work similarly to regular annotation jobs - they can be assigned, annotated, imported and exported. When you decide to merge annotations from replicas, the results will be written to the parent annotation job.\nKey properties of consensus replica jobs:\nReplicas are connected to annotation jobs. Each annotation job can have several related replicas. Only annotation jobs can have replicas. Ground Truth jobs cannot have replicas. Replicas use the same frame range as their parent annotation jobs. Annotations in replicas and parent jobs are independent from each other. Modifying a replica doesn’t affect the parent job or other replicas and vice versa. Removing annotations in a parent job doesn’t change annotations in its replicas. Replicas are not included in task annotation import or export. Per-job import and export still work for all job types, including replicas. Read more about merging here.\nWorkflow When annotating with consensus, the typical workflow looks this way:\nCreate a task with consensus enabled. Optionally, configure validation Assign annotators to consensus replicas, wait until all the jobs are completed Once all replicas in a parent job are completed, merge annotations Review and resolve problems in the parent jobs How to enable consensus in a task Consensus annotation is configured at the Task level. It can only be specified at task creation. If you want to enable consensus for one of your existing tasks, you’ll need to recreate the task.\nGo to the task creation page Configure basic and advanced parameters according to your requirements, and attach a dataset to be annotated. To enable consensus for the task, open the Advanced section and set Consensus Replicas to a value greater than 1. Create the task and open the task page If a task has consensus enabled, you’ll see the Consensus tag in the task summary. Existing Consensus replica jobs will be displayed in the job list under their parent annotation jobs.\nMerging For a given parent job with related annotated consensus jobs, merging will match annotations between the replicas and save merged annotations into the parent job.\nWarning Please note that merging overrides annotations in the parent job. This operation cannot be undone. Please make sure that the parent job is ready for merging and backup annotations if needed. There are 2 merging options available:\nmerge replicas in all available parent jobs in a task merge replicas in a specific parent job Merging is only available for a parent job if it is in the annotation stage and it has at least 1 replica not in the annotation - new stage and state. For simplicity, this can be read as “if there are any annotated replicas in the parent job”.\nAfter merging, parent jobs are switched to the completed state automatically. If you prefer merging at the task level, it is recommended to switch merged parent jobs to the validation stage after they are merged to exclude them from the next merging and avoid losing the reviewed annotations.\nHow to merge all replicas in a task Open the task Actions menu Click Merge consensus jobs Click Merge in the dialog window The operation can take some time to be completed. Once it is completed, you will receive a status notification in the top right corner.\nHow to merge replicas in a specific parent job Open the job Actions menu Click Merge consensus job Click Merge in the dialog window The operation can take some time to be completed. Once it is completed, you will receive a status notification in the top right corner.\nReview and resolve problems After merging replicas, the parent job will contain merged annotations with consensus scores. These scores help you identify which annotations may need closer review.\nUnderstanding consensus scores Each merged annotation has two important properties:\nScore: A value from 0 to 1 that indicates the level of agreement between annotators. A score of 1.0 means all replicas agreed on this annotation, while lower scores indicate less agreement between annotators. Votes: An approximate number showing how many annotators agreed on this annotation. This is a UI-only value calculated as replicas × score. For example, with 5 replicas and a score of 0.8, the votes value would be approximately 4. Annotations with lower scores may indicate:\nAmbiguous or difficult-to-annotate objects Inconsistent annotation guidelines Objects that need closer review Filtering low-confidence annotations Before starting manual review, you may want to filter out annotations with low scores to reduce the review workload. To do this:\nOpen the merged parent job in the annotation view Use the filters panel to filter annotations by score Review the filtered annotations and delete those that don’t meet your quality requirements Save the annotations Note Deleting low-score annotations is optional. You may prefer to review all annotations manually to ensure nothing valuable is removed. Manual review process Once filtering is complete (or if you skip filtering), proceed with manual review:\nOpen the merged parent job in the annotation view, enable review mode\nNavigate through annotations using keyboard shortcuts:\nTab: Go to the next object Shift+Tab: Go to the previous object For each annotation, decide on one of the following actions:\nAccept the annotation: If the annotation is correct, simply move to the next object Adjust the annotation: If the annotation needs modifications: Press L to unlock the object Make necessary adjustments (resize, reposition, change attributes, etc.) Press L again to lock the object Move to the next object Delete the annotation: If the annotation is completely wrong: Press L to unlock the object Press Delete or use the context menu to remove it Move to the next object After reviewing all annotations, save your work using Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on macOS)\nConfiguration Merging settings If you want to tweak some aspects of merging, you can do this on the Consensus Management page. It is available in the task Actions menu. Hover over the ? marks to understand what each field represents.\nAfter you set values for the parameters, click the Save button. The updated settings will take effect on the next merging.\nThe following parameters are available:\nShape comparison Min overlap Min overlap threshold used for the distinction between matched and unmatched annotations. Used to match all types of annotations. It corresponds to the Intersection over union (IoU) for spatial annotations, such as bounding boxes and masks. Read more about annotation matching here. Keep in mind that quality settings do not affect consensus merging.

The fast navigation between frames which have an object of interest. Use the Left Arrow / Right Arrow keys for this purpose or customize the UI buttons by right-clicking and select switching by filter. If there are no objects which correspond to the filter, you will go to the previous / next frame which contains any annotated objects. To apply filters you need to click on the button on the top panel.\nCreate a filter It will open a window for filter input. Here you will find two buttons: Add rule and Add group.\nRules The Add rule button adds a rule for objects display. A rule may use the following properties:\nSupported properties for annotation Properties Supported values Description Label all the label names that are in the task label name Type shape, track or tag type of object Shape all shape types type of shape Occluded true or false occluded (read more) Width number of px or field shape width Height number of px or field shape height ServerID number or field ID of the object on the server (You can find out by forming a link to the object through the Action menu) ObjectID number or field ID of the object in your client (indicated on the objects sidebar) Score number consensus score Votes number consensus votes Attributes some other fields including attributes with a similar type or a specific attribute value any fields specified by a label Supported properties for projects list Supported properties for tasks list Supported properties for jobs list Supported properties for cloud storages list Supported operators for properties == - Equally; != - Not equal; \u003e - More; \u003e= - More or equal; \u003c - Less; \u003c= - Less or equal;\nAny in; Not in - these operators allow you to set multiple values in one rule;\nIs empty; is not empty – these operators don’t require to input a value.\nBetween; Not between – these operators allow you to choose a range between two values.\nLike - this operator indicate that the property must contain a value.\nStarts with; Ends with - filter by beginning or end.\nSome properties support two types of values that you can choose:\nYou can add multiple rules, to do so click the add rule button and set another rule. Once you’ve set a new rule, you’ll be able to choose which operator they will be connected by: And or Or.\nAll subsequent rules will be joined by the chosen operator. Click Submit to apply the filter or if you want multiple rules to be connected by different operators, use groups.\nGroups To add a group, click the Add group button. Inside the group you can create rules or groups.\nIf there is more than one rule in the group, they can be connected by And or Or operators. The rule group will work as well as a separate rule outside the group and will be joined by an operator outside the group. You can create groups within other groups, to do so you need to click the add group button within the group.\nYou can move rules and groups. To move the rule or group, drag it by the button. To remove the rule or group, click on the Delete button.\nIf you activate the Not button, objects that don’t match the group will be filtered out. Click Submit to apply the filter. The Cancel button undoes the filter. The Clear filter button removes the filter.\nOnce applied filter automatically appears in Recent used list. Maximum length of the list is 10.\nSort and filter lists On the projects, task list on the project page, tasks, jobs, and cloud storage pages, you can use sorting and filters.\nNote The applied filter and sorting will be displayed in the URL of your browser, Thus, you can share the page with sorting and filter applied. Sort by You can sort by the following parameters:\nJobs list: ID, assignee, updated date, stage, state, task ID, project ID, task name, project name. Tasks list or tasks list on project page: ID, owner, status, assignee, updated date, subset, mode, dimension, project ID, name, project name.

API includes Repositories and Entities. Repositories provide management operations for Entities. Entities represent objects on the server (e.g. projects, tasks, jobs etc) and simplify interaction with them. The key difference from the low-level API is that operations on this layer are not limited by a single server request per operation and encapsulate low-level request machinery behind a high-level object-oriented API.\nThe code of this component is located in the cvat_sdk.core package.\nExample from cvat_sdk import make_client, models from cvat_sdk.core.proxies.tasks import ResourceType, Task # Create a Client instance bound to a local server and authenticate using basic auth with make_client(\"http://localhost\", credentials=('user', 'password')) as client: # Let's create a new task. # Fill in task parameters first. # Models are used the same way as in the layer 1. task_spec = { \"name\": \"example task\", \"labels\": [ { \"name\": \"car\", \"color\": \"#ff00ff\", \"attributes\": [ { \"name\": \"a\", \"mutable\": True, \"input_type\": \"number\", \"default_value\": \"5\", \"values\": [\"4\", \"5\", \"6\"], } ], } ], } # Now we can create a task using a task repository method. # Repositories can be accessed as the Client class members. # In this case we use 2 local images as the task data. task = client.tasks.create_from_data( spec=task_spec, resource_type=ResourceType.LOCAL, resources=['image1.jpg', 'image2.png'], ) # The returned task object is already up-to-date with its server counterpart. # Now we can access task fields. The fields are read-only and can be optional. # Let's check that we have 2 images in the task data. assert task.size == 2 # If an object is modified on the server, the local object is not updated automatically. # To reflect the latest changes, the local object needs to be fetch()-ed. task.fetch() # Let's obtain another task. Again, it can be done via the task repository. # Suppose we have already created the task earlier and know the task id. task2 = client.tasks.retrieve(42) # The task object fields can be update()-d. Note that the set of fields that can be # modified can be different from what is available for reading. task2.update({'name': 'my task'}) # And the task can also be remove()-d from the server. The local copy will remain # untouched. task2.remove() Client The cvat_sdk.core.client.Client class provides session management, implements authentication operations and simplifies access to server APIs. It is the starting point for using CVAT SDK.\nA Client instance allows you to:\nconfigure connection options with the Config class check server API compatibility with the current SDK version manage user session with the login(), logout() and other methods obtain high-level server object wrappers with the users, tasks, jobs and other members reach lower-level APIs to send raw requests, typically via the api member of the object An instance of Client can be created directly by calling the class constructor or with the utility function cvat_sdk.core.client.make_client() which can handle some configuration for you. A Client can be configured with the cvat_sdk.core.client.Config class instance. A Config object can be passed to the Client constructor and then it will be available in the Client.config field.\nThe Client class implements the context manager protocol. When the context is closed, the session is finished, and the user is logged out automatically. Otherwise, these actions can be done with the close() and logout() methods.\nYou can create and start using a Client instance this way:\nfrom cvat_sdk import make_client with make_client(\"https://app.cvat.ai\", credentials=(\"user\", \"password\")) as client: ... The make_client() function handles configuration and object creation for you. It also allows to authenticate right after the object is created.\nIf you need to configure Client parameters, you can do this:\nfrom cvat_sdk import Config, Client config = Config() # set up some config fields ... with Client(\"https://app.cvat.ai\", config=config) as client: client.login((\"user\", \"password\")) ... Note Historically, the SDK has allowed the URL scheme (http: or https:) to be omitted, and would attempt to automatically detect the protocol. This behavior is deprecated due to being inherently insecure, and will be removed in a future version. To avoid future breakage, make sure to specify the scheme explicitly. When the server is located, its version is checked. If an unsupported version is found, an error can be raised or suppressed (controlled by config.allow_unsupported_server). If the error is suppressed, some SDK functions may not work as expected with this server. By default, a warning is raised and the error is suppressed.\nAuthentication High-level SDK supports 2 authentication options:\nPersonal Access Token (PAT) authentication, with an access token value Password authentication, with a username and a password Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication requires a token that can be configured in the user settings section in the UI. It is the recommended authentication option for most API clients. Read more.\nPassword authentication requires a username and password pair. For better security it’s recommended to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead, if possible.\nPersonal Access Token (PAT) authentication Password authentication from cvat_sdk import make_client with make_client(\"https://app.cvat.ai\", access_token=\"token\") as client: ... from cvat_sdk import make_client with make_client(\"https://app.cvat.ai\", credentials=(\"user\", \"password\")) as client: ... With the make_client() function, the Client object create will perform authentication automatically for you. If you want more fine-grained control over the requests, there are several methods available:\nclient.login() - logs the user in using the specified credentials client.logout() - logs the user out client.has_credentials() - allows to check whether the client object is authenticated Example:\nfrom cvat_sdk.core.client import Client, AccessTokenCredentials with Client(\"https://app.cvat.ai\") as client: client.login(AccessTokenCredentials(\"token\")) # ... If the Client is used as a context manager (with the with keyword), it automatically calls logout() before exiting.\nUsers and organizations All Client operations rely on the server API and depend on the current user rights. This affects the set of available APIs, objects and actions. For example, a regular user can only see and modify their tasks and jobs, while an admin user can see all the tasks etc.\nOperations are also affected by the current organization context, which can be set with the organization_slug property of Client instances. The organization context affects which entities are visible, and where new entities are created.\nSet organization_slug to an organization’s slug (short name) to make subsequent operations work in the context of that organization:\nclient.organization_slug = 'myorg' # create a task in the organization task = client.tasks.create_from_data(...) You can also set organization_slug to an empty string to work in the context of the user’s personal workspace. By default, it is set to None, which means that both personal and organizational entities are visible, while new entities are created in the personal workspace.\nTo temporarily set the organization slug, use the organization_context function:\nwith client.organization_context('myorg'): task = client.tasks.create_from_data(...) # the slug is now reset to its previous value Entities and Repositories Entities represent objects on the server. They provide read access to object fields and implement additional relevant operations, including both the general Read-Update-Delete and object-specific ones. The set of available general operations depends on the object type.\nRepositories provide management operations for corresponding Entities. You don’t need to create Repository objects manually. To obtain a Repository object, use the corresponding Client instance member:\nclient.projects client.tasks client.jobs client.users ... An Entity can be created on the server with the corresponding Repository method create():\ntask = client.tasks.create(\u003ctask config\u003e) We can retrieve server objects using the retrieve() and list() methods of the Repository:\njob = client.jobs.retrieve(\u003cjob id\u003e) tasks = client.tasks.list() After calling these functions, we obtain local objects representing their server counterparts.\nObject fields can be updated with the update() method. Note that the set of fields that can be modified can be different from what is available for reading.\njob.update({'stage': 'validation'}) The server object will be updated and the local object will reflect the latest object state after calling this operation.\nNote that local objects may fall out of sync with their server counterparts for different reasons. If you need to update the local object with the latest server state, use the fetch() method:\n# obtain 2 local copies of the same job job_ref1 = client.jobs.retrieve(1) job_ref2 = client.jobs.retrieve(1) # update the server object with the first reference job_ref1.update(...) # job_ref2 is outdated now job_ref2.fetch() # job_ref2 is synced Finally, if you need to remove the object from the server, you can use the remove() method. The server object will be removed, but the local copy of the object will remain untouched.\ntask = client.tasks.retrieve(\u003ctask id\u003e) task.remove() Repositories can also provide group operations over entities. For instance, you can retrieve all available objects using the list() Repository method. The list of available Entity and Repository operations depends on the object type.\nYou can learn more about entity members and how model parameters are passed to functions here.\nThe implementation for these components is located in cvat_sdk.core.proxies.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Overview This layer provides high-level APIs, allowing easier access …","ref":"/docs/api_sdk/sdk/highlevel-api/","tags":"","title":"High-level API"},{"body":"On the Jobs page, users (for example, with the worker role) can see the jobs that are assigned to them without having access to the task page, as well as track progress, sort, and apply filters to the job list.\nOn the page, there is a list of jobs presented in the form of tiles, where each tile is one job.

When an annotator finishes a job, a dialog is displayed showing the quality of their annotations. The annotator can either agree or disagree with the feedback. If they disagree, they have the option to re-annotate the job and request feedback again.\nTo ensure transparency with the annotator, the immediate feedback shows the computed score and the minimum required score. Information about the specific errors or frames that have errors is not available to annotators.\nFeedback is only available a limited number of times for each assignment, to prevent Ground Truth revealing by annotators. This is controlled by a configurable parameter, so it can be adjusted to the requirements of each project.\nHow to configure Immediate feedback settings, such as Target metric, Target metric threshold, Max validations per job and others, can be configured on the quality settings page.\nThis feature is considered enabled if the Max validations per job is above 0. You can change the parameters any time.\nNote This feature requires a configured validation set in the task. Read more in the quality overview section or in the full guide.

To use it, you must install the cvat_sdk distribution with the pytorch extra.\nExample import torch import torchvision.models from cvat_sdk import make_client from cvat_sdk.pytorch import ProjectVisionDataset, ExtractSingleLabelIndex # create a PyTorch model model = torchvision.models.resnet34( weights=torchvision.models.ResNet34_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1) model.eval() # log into the CVAT server with make_client(\"http://localhost\", credentials=('user', 'password')) as client: # get the dataset comprising all tasks for the Validation subset of project 12345 dataset = ProjectVisionDataset(client, project_id=12345, include_subsets=['Validation'], # use transforms that fit our neural network transform=torchvision.models.ResNet34_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1.transforms(), target_transform=ExtractSingleLabelIndex()) # print the number of images in the dataset (in other words, the number of frames # in the included tasks) print(len(dataset)) # get a sample from the dataset image, target = dataset[0] # evaluate the network on the sample and compare the output to the target output = model(image) if torch.equal(output, target): print(\"correct prediction\") else: print(\"incorrect prediction\") Datasets The key components of this layer are the dataset classes, ProjectVisionDataset and TaskVisionDataset, representing data \u0026 annotations contained in a CVAT project or task, respectively. Both of them are subclasses of the torch.utils.data.Dataset abstract class.\nThe interface of Dataset is essentially that of a sequence whose elements are samples from the dataset. In the case of TaskVisionDataset, each sample represents a frame from the task and its associated annotations. The order of the samples is the same as the order of frames in the task. Deleted frames are omitted.\nIn the case of ProjectVisionDataset, each sample is a sample from one of the project’s tasks, as if obtained from a TaskVisionDataset instance created for that task. The full sequence of samples is built by concatenating the sequences of samples from all included tasks in an unspecified order that is guaranteed to be consistent between executions. For details on what tasks are included, see Task filtering.\nConstruction Both dataset classes are instantiated by passing in an instance of cvat_sdk.Client and the ID of the project or task:\ndataset = ProjectVisionDataset(client, 123) dataset = TaskVisionDataset(client, 456) The referenced project or task must contain image data. Video data is currently not supported.\nThe constructors of these classes also support several keyword-only parameters:\ntransforms, transform, target_transform: see Transform support.\nlabel_name_to_index: see Label index assignment.\ntask_filter, include_subsets (ProjectVisionDataset only): see Task filtering.\nupdate_policy: see Caching.\nDuring construction, the dataset objects either populate or validate the local data cache (see Caching for details). Any necessary requests to the CVAT server are performed at this time. After construction, the objects make no more network requests.\nSample format Indexing a dataset produces a sample. A sample has the form of a tuple with the following components:\nsample[0] (PIL.Image.Image): the image. sample[1] (cvat_sdk.pytorch.Target): the annotations and auxiliary data. The target object contains the following attributes:\ntarget.annotations.tags (list[cvat_sdk.models.LabeledImage]): tag annotations associated with the current frame. target.annotations.shapes (list[cvat_sdk.models.LabeledShape]): shape annotations associated with the current frame. target.label_id_to_index (Mapping[int, int]): see Label index assignment. Note that track annotations are currently inaccessible.\nTransform support The dataset classes support torchvision-like transforms that you can supply to preprocess each sample before it’s returned. You can use this to convert the samples to a more convenient format or to preprocess the data. The transforms are supplied via the following constructor parameters:\ntransforms: a callable that accepts two arguments (the image and the target) and returns a tuple with two elements. transform: a callable that accepts an image. target_transform: a callable that accepts a target. Let the sample value prior to any transformations be (image, target). Here is what indexing the dataset will return for various combinations of supplied transforms:\ntransforms: transforms(image, target). transform: (transform(image), target). target_transform: (image, target_transform(target)). transform and target_transform: (transform(image), target_transform(target)). transforms cannot be supplied at the same time as either transform or target_transform.\nThe cvat_sdk.pytorch module contains some target transform classes that are intended for common use cases. See Transforms.\nLabel index assignment The annotation model classes (LabeledImage and LabeledShape) reference labels by their IDs on the CVAT server. This is usually not very useful for machine learning code, since those IDs are unpredictable and will be different between different projects, even if semantically the set of labels is the same.\nTherefore, the dataset classes assign to each label a unique index that is intended to be a project-independent identifier. These indices are accessible via the label_id_to_index attribute on each sample’s target. This attribute maps IDs on the server to the assigned index. The mapping is the same for every sample.\nBy default, the dataset classes arrange all label IDs in an unspecified order that remains consistent across executions, and assign them sequential indices, starting with 0.\nYou can override this behavior and specify your own label indices with the label_name_to_index constructor parameter. This parameter accepts a mapping from label name to index. The mapping must contain a key for each label in the project/task. When this parameter is specified, label indices are assigned by looking up each label’s name in the provided mapping and using the result.\nTask filtering Note: this section applies only to ProjectVisionDataset.\nBy default, a ProjectVisionDataset includes samples from every task belonging to the project. You can change this using the following constructor parameters:\ntask_filter (Callable[[models.ITaskRead], bool]): if set, the callable will be called for every task, with an instance of ITaskRead corresponding to that task passed as the argument. Only tasks for which True is returned will be included.\ninclude_subsets (Container[str]): if set, only tasks whose subset is a member of the container will be included.\nBoth parameters can be set, in which case tasks must fulfill both criteria to be included.\nCaching The images and annotations of a dataset can be substantial in size, so they are not downloaded from the server every time a dataset object is created. Instead, they are loaded from a cache on the local file system, which is maintained during dataset object construction according to the policy set by the update_policy constructor parameter.\nThe available policies are:\nUpdatePolicy.IF_MISSING_OR_STALE: If some data is already cached, query the server to determine if it is out of date. If so, discard it. Then, download all necessary data that is missing from the cache and cache it.\nThis is the default policy.\nUpdatePolicy.NEVER: If some necessary data is missing from the cache, raise an exception. Don’t make any network requests.\nNote that this policy permits the use of stale data.\nBy default, the cache is located in a platform-specific per-user directory. You can change this location with the cache_dir setting in the Client configuration.\nTransforms The layer provides some classes whose instances are callables suitable for usage with the target_transform dataset constructor parameter that are intended to simplify working with CVAT datasets in common scenarios.\nExtractBoundingBoxes Intended for object detection tasks.\nConstructor parameters:\ninclude_shape_types (Iterable[str]). The values must be from the following list:\n\"ellipse\" \"points\" \"polygon\" \"polyline\" \"rectangle\" Effect: Gathers all shape annotations from the input target object whose types are contained in the value of include_shape_types. Then returns a dictionary with the following string keys (where N is the number of gathered shapes):\n\"boxes\" (a floating-point tensor of shape Nx4). Each row represents the bounding box the corresponding shape in the following format: [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max].\n\"labels\" (an integer tensor of shape N). Each element is the index of the label of the corresponding shape.\nExample:\nExtractBoundingBoxes(include_shape_types=['rectangle', 'ellipse']) ExtractSingleLabelIndex Intended for image classification tasks.\nConstructor parameters: None.\nEffect: If the input target object contains no tag annotations or more than one tag annotation, raises ValueError. Otherwise, returns the index of the label in the solitary tag annotation as a zero-dimensional tensor.\nExample:\nExtractSingleLabelIndex() ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Overview This layer provides functionality that enables you to treat …","ref":"/docs/api_sdk/sdk/pytorch-adapter/","tags":"","title":"PyTorch adapter"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Learn how to ensure annotation quality with validation tools, Ground Truth jobs, Honeypots, and performance analytics.","excerpt":"Learn how to ensure annotation quality with validation tools, Ground …","ref":"/docs/qa-analytics/","tags":"","title":"QA \u0026 Analytics"},{"body":"CVAT supports Single Sign-On (SSO) using both OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocols.\nTo configure SSO, complete the following 2 main steps:\nConfigure the Identity Provider (IdP) — set up an application on your IdP platform.

For additional CVAT configuration details, refer to Configuring SSO in CVAT.\nConfiguring SSO in CVAT CVAT provides a dedicated configuration file to customize the login and registration flow. The sso section of this file specifies which external Identity Provider (IdP) integrations are enabled. To set up SSO, you typically create a custom YAML configuration file (e.g., auth_config.yml) and supply its path when starting CVAT.\nSSO settings Setting Description enabled Enables or disables Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality. selection_mode Defines how the Identity Provider (IdP) is selected for authenticating a given user.\nAvailable modes:\nemail_address (default): Selects the IdP based on the domain of the user’s email address.lowest_weight: Selects the IdP with the lowest configured weight. enable_pkce Controls whether Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is enabled for the authentication flow (disabled by default). This setting applies to all configured OIDC-based Identity Providers --- sso: enabled: true|false selection_mode: email_address|lowest_weight enable_pkce: true|false ... IdP Configuration Structure To integrate an Identity Provider, you must define its configuration block under the identity_providers section in the CVAT config file. Each provider’s configuration includes both general and protocol-specific settings.\nSetting Required Description id required A unique, URL-safe identifier for the IdP. Used in callback URLs. name required A human-readable name for the IdP. protocol required Authentication protocol (OIDC/SAML). email_domain optional Company email domain (used with email_address selection mode). weight optional Determines priority (used with lowest_weight selection mode). The default is 10. Additionally, each IdP configuration must include several protocol-specific parameters: OpenID Connect SAML client_id and client_secret (required): These values can be obtained from the configuration page of the specific provider.\nserver_url (required): URL is used to obtain IdP OpenID Configuration Metadata.\nNOTE: How to check server_url correctness: server_url + /.well-known/openid-configuration API should exist and return OpenID Provider Metadata. Generally, each authentication platform provides a list of all endpoints. You need to find the corresponding endpoint and select the part in front of /.well-known/openid-configuration. For example, in the case of integrating an OIDC Microsoft Entry ID application, don’t forget to specify the second version of API (https://login.microsoftonline.com/\u003ctenant_id\u003e/v2.0).\ntoken_auth_method (optional): Token endpoint authentication method which can be one of client_secret_basic, client_secret_post. If this field is omitted, a method from the server’s token auth methods list will be used.\nentity_id (required): IdP entity ID, should be equal to the corresponding setting in the IdP configuration. metadata_url (optional): SAML metadata URL. This can typically be found on the IdP configuration page. x509_cert (optional): The SAML X.509 certificate. Also could be found in the IdP’s configuration. If the metadata_url is not specified, this parameter becomes required. sso_url (optional): SAML endpoint for the Single Sign-On service. Also could be found in the IdP’s configuration. If the metadata_url is not specified, this parameter becomes required. attribute_mapping (required): A mapping between user account attributes and attributes sent by the Identity Provider. Below are examples of SSO configuration file for both protocols: Integrate OIDC-based IdP Integrate SAML-based IdP --- sso: enabled: true selection_mode: email_address identity_providers: - id: oidc-idp protocol: OIDC name: OIDC-based IdP server_url: https://example.com client_id: xxx client_secret: xxx email_domain: example.com --- sso: enabled: true selection_mode: lowest_weight identity_providers: - id: saml-idp protocol: SAML name: SAML-based IdP entity_id: \u003cidp-entity-id\u003e weight: 1 # specify only metadata_url or sso_url and x509_cert metadata_url: http://example.com/path/to/saml/metadata/ sso_url: \u003cLogin URL\u003e x509_cert: | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- certificate content -----END CERTIFICATE----- attribute_mapping: uid: uidAttribute email_verified: emailVerifiedAttribute email: emailAttribute last_name: lastNameAttribute first_name: firstNameAttribute username: usernameAttribute More information about OIDC-based and SAML-based IdP configuration expected by Django Allauth can be found here and here respectively.\nStart CVAT Restart required If CVAT is already running, don’t forget to restart the containers to apply the SSO configuration Once the configuration file is created, several environment variables must be exported before running CVAT:\nexport AUTH_CONFIG_PATH=\"\u003cpath_to_auth_config\u003e\" export CVAT_HOST=\"\u003ccvat_host\u003e\" # cvat_port is optional export CVAT_BASE_URL=\"\u003chttp|https\u003e://${CVAT_HOST}:\u003ccvat_port\u003e\" Start the CVAT Enterprise instance as usual.\nThat’s it!

This is a Python object that implements one of the protocols defined by this layer. The particular protocol implemented defines which part of the annotation process the AA function will be able to automate.\nAn AA function may be used in one of the following modes:\nImmediate mode. This involves annotating a specific CVAT task by passing the AA function to a driver, along with the identifier of the task and optional additional parameters. This may be done either:\nprogrammatically (consult the “Auto-annotation driver” section (TODO)); or\nvia the CVAT CLI (consult the description of the task auto-annotate command in the CLI documentation).\nAgent mode. This involves registering the AA function with the CVAT server (creating a resource on the server known as a “native function”) and then running one or more agent processes.\nThis makes the AA function usable from the CVAT UI. CVAT users can choose to use the native function as the model when using CVAT’s AI tools. When they do, the agents detect this, and process their requests by calling appropriate methods on the corresponding AA function.\nDepending on how you create the native function, it’ll be accessible to only you, or your organization.\nFor more details, consult the descriptions of the function create-native and function run-agent commands in the CLI documentation.\nThis SDK layer can be divided into several parts:\nThe interface, containing the protocols that an AA function must implement, as well as helpers for use by such functions. Consult Auto-annotation interface.\nThe driver, containing functionality to annotate a CVAT dataset using an AA function. Consult Auto-annotation driver.\nPredefined AA functions based on torchvision. Consult Predefined AA functions.\nWhile not part of the SDK, there are also additional predefined AA functions in the CVAT source repository. Consult Additional AA functions.\nExample An AA function may be implemented in any way that is appropriate for your use case. However, a typical AA function will be based on a machine learning model and consist of the following basic elements:\nCode to load the ML model.\nA specification defining which protocol the AA function implements, as well as static properties of the AA function (such as a description of the annotations that the AA function can produce).\nCode to convert data from SDK data structures to a format the ML model can understand.\nCode to run the ML model.\nCode to convert resulting annotations to SDK data structures.\nThe following code snippet shows an example AA function implementation (specifically, a detection function), as well as code that creates an instance of the function and uses it for auto-annotation.\nfrom typing import List import PIL.Image import torchvision.models from cvat_sdk import make_client import cvat_sdk.models as models import cvat_sdk.auto_annotation as cvataa class TorchvisionDetectionFunction: def __init__(self, model_name: str, weights_name: str, **kwargs) -\u003e None: # load the ML model weights_enum = torchvision.models.get_model_weights(model_name) self._weights = weights_enum[weights_name] self._transforms = self._weights.transforms() self._model = torchvision.models.get_model(model_name, weights=self._weights, **kwargs) self._model.eval() @property def spec(self) -\u003e cvataa.DetectionFunctionSpec: # describe the annotations return cvataa.DetectionFunctionSpec( labels=[ cvataa.label_spec(cat, i, type=\"rectangle\") for i, cat in enumerate(self._weights.meta[\"categories\"]) if cat != \"N/A\" ] ) def detect( self, context: cvataa.DetectionFunctionContext, image: PIL.Image.Image ) -\u003e list[models.LabeledShapeRequest]: # determine the threshold for filtering results conf_threshold = context.conf_threshold or 0 # convert the input into a form the model can understand transformed_image = [self._transforms(image)] # run the ML model results = self._model(transformed_image) # convert the results into the form SDK requires return [ cvataa.rectangle(label.item(), [x.item() for x in box]) for result in results for box, label, score in zip(result[\"boxes\"], result[\"labels\"], result[\"scores\"]) if score \u003e= conf_threshold ] # log into the CVAT server with make_client(\"http://localhost\", credentials=(\"user\", \"password\")) as client: # create a function that uses Faster R-CNN func = TorchvisionDetectionFunction(\"fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn_v2\", \"DEFAULT\", box_score_thresh=0.5) # annotate task 12345 using the function cvataa.annotate_task(client, 12345, func) Auto-annotation interface This part of the auto-annotation layer defines the protocols that an AA function must implement.\nDetection function protocol A detection function is a type of AA function that accepts an image and returns a list of shapes found in that image.\nA detection function can be used in the following ways:\nIn immediate mode, the AA function is run for every image in a given CVAT task, and the resulting lists of shapes are combined and uploaded to CVAT.\nIn agent mode, the AA function can be used from the CVAT UI to either annotate a complete task (similar to immediate mode) or a single frame in a task.\nA detection function must have two attributes, spec and detect.\nspec must contain the AA function’s specification, which is an instance of DetectionFunctionSpec.\nDetectionFunctionSpec must be initialized with a sequence of PatchedLabelRequest objects that represent the labels that the AA function knows about. See the docstring of DetectionFunctionSpec for more information on the constraints that these objects must follow. BadFunctionError will be raised if any constraint violations are detected.\ndetect must be a function/method accepting two parameters:\ncontext (DetectionFunctionContext). Contains invocation parameters and information about the current image. The following fields are available:\nframe_name (str). The file name of the frame on the CVAT server. conf_threshold (float | None). The confidence threshold that the function should use to filter objects. If None, the function may apply a default threshold at its discretion. image (PIL.Image.Image). Contains image data.\ndetect must return a sequence of LabeledImageRequest and/or LabeledShapeRequest objects, representing tags/shapes found in the image. See the docstring of DetectionFunctionSpec for more information on the constraints that these objects must follow.\nThe same AA function may be used with any dataset that contain labels with the same name as the AA function’s specification. The way it works is that the driver matches labels between the spec and the dataset, and replaces the label IDs in the tag \u0026 shape objects with those defined in the dataset.\nFor example, suppose the AA function’s spec defines the following labels:\nName ID bat 0 rat 1 And the dataset defines the following labels:\nName ID bat 100 cat 101 rat 102 Then suppose detect returns a shape with label_id equal to 1. The driver will see that it refers to the rat label, and replace it with 102, since that’s the ID this label has in the dataset.\nThe same logic is used for sublabel and attribute IDs.\nHelper factory functions The CVAT API model types used in the detection function protocol are somewhat unwieldy to work with, so it’s recommended to use the helper factory functions provided by this layer. These helpers instantiate an object of their corresponding model type, passing their arguments to the model constructor and sometimes setting some attributes to fixed values.\nThe following helpers are available for building specifications:\nName Model type Fixed attributes label_spec PatchedLabelRequest - skeleton_label_spec PatchedLabelRequest type=\"skeleton\" keypoint_spec SublabelRequest type=\"points\" attribute_spec AttributeRequest mutable=False checkbox_attribute_spec AttributeRequest mutable=False, input_type=\"checkbox\", values=[] number_attribute_spec AttributeRequest mutable=False, input_type=\"number\" radio_attribute_spec AttributeRequest mutable=False, input_type=\"radio\" select_attribute_spec AttributeRequest mutable=False, input_type=\"select\" text_attribute_spec AttributeRequest mutable=False, input_type=\"number\", values=[] For number_attribute_spec, it’s recommended to use the cvat_sdk.attributes.number_attribute_values function to create the values argument, since this function will enforce the constraints expected for attribute specs of this type. For example:\ncvataa.number_attribute_spec(\"size\", 1, number_attribute_values(0, 10)) The following helpers are available for use in detect:\nName Model type Fixed attributes tag LabeledImageRequest frame=0 shape LabeledShapeRequest frame=0 mask LabeledShapeRequest frame=0, type=\"mask\" polygon LabeledShapeRequest frame=0, type=\"polygon\" rectangle LabeledShapeRequest frame=0, type=\"rectangle\" skeleton LabeledShapeRequest frame=0, type=\"skeleton\" keypoint SubLabeledShapeRequest frame=0, type=\"points\" For mask, it is recommended to create the points list using the cvat_sdk.masks.encode_mask function, which will convert a bitmap into a list in the format that CVAT expects. For example:\ncvataa.mask(my_label, encode_mask( my_mask, # boolean 2D array, same size as the input image [x1, y1, x2, y2], # top left and bottom right coordinates of the mask )) To create shapes with attributes, it’s recommended to use the cvat_sdk.attributes.attribute_vals_from_dict function, which returns a list of objects that can be passed to an attributes argument:\ncvataa.rectangle( my_label, [x1, y2, x2, y2], attributes=attribute_vals_from_dict({my_attr1: val1, my_attr2: val2}) ) Tracking function protocol A tracking function is a type of AA function that analyzes an image with one or more shapes on it, and then predicts the positions of those shapes on subsequent images.\nA tracking function can only be used in agent mode. When used with a tracking function, an agent will use it to process requests from the AI tracking tools in the CVAT UI.\nWarning Currently, only one agent should be run for each tracking function. If multiple agents for one tracking function are run at the same time, CVAT users may experience intermittent “Tracking state not found” errors when using the function. A tracking function must have three attributes, spec, init_tracking_state, and track. It may also optionally have a preprocess_image attribute.\nspec must contain the AA function’s specification, which is an instance of TrackingFunctionSpec. This specification must be initialized with a single supported_shape_types parameter, defining which types of shapes the AA function is able to track. For example:\nspec = cvataa.TrackingFunctionSpec(supported_shape_types=[\"rectangle\"]) init_tracking_state must be a function accepting the following parameters:\ncontext (TrackingFunctionShapeContext). An object with information about the shape being tracked. See details below.\npp_image (type varies). A preprocessed image. Consult the description of preprocess_image for more details.\nshape (TrackableShape). A shape within the preprocessed image. TrackableShape is a minimal version of the LabeledShape SDK model, containing only the type and points fields. The shape’s type is guaranteed to be one of the types listed in the supported_shape_types field of the spec.\ninit_tracking_state must analyze the shape and create a state object containing any information that the AA function will need to predict its location on a subsequent image. It must then return this object.\ninit_tracking_state must not modify either pp_image or shape.\ntrack must be a function accepting the following parameters:\ncontext (TrackingFunctionShapeContext). An object with information about the shape being tracked. See details below.\npp_image (type varies). A preprocessed image. Consult the description of preprocess_image for more details. This image will have the same dimensions as those of the image used to create the state object.\nstate (type varies). The object returned by a previous call to init_tracking_state.\ntrack must locate the shape that was used to create the state object on the new preprocessed image. If it is able to do that, it must return its prediction as a new TrackableShape object. This object must have the same value of type as the original shape.\nIf track is unable to locate the shape, it must return None.\ntrack may modify state as needed to improve prediction accuracy on subsequent frames. It must not modify pp_image.\nA TrackingFunctionShapeContext object passed to both init_tracking_state and track will have the following field:\noriginal_shape_type (str). The type of the shape being tracked. In init_tracking_state, this is the same as shape.type. In track, this is the type of the shape that state was created from. preprocess_image, if implemented, must accept the following parameters:\ncontext (TrackingFunctionContext). This is currently a dummy object and should be ignored. In future versions, this may contain additional information.\nimage (PIL.Image.Image). An image that will be used to either start or continue tracking.\npreprocess_image must perform any analysis on the image that the function can perform independently of the shapes being tracked and return an object representing the results of that analysis. This object will be passed as pp_image to init_tracking_state and track.\nIf preprocess_image is not implemented, then the pp_image object will be the original image. In other words, the default implementation is:\ndef preprocess_image(context, image): return image Auto-annotation driver The annotate_task function uses a detection function to annotate a CVAT task. It must be called as follows:\nannotate_task(\u003cclient\u003e, \u003ctask ID\u003e, \u003cAA function\u003e, \u003coptional arguments...\u003e) The supplied client will be used to make all API calls.\nBy default, new annotations will be appended to the old ones. Use clear_existing=True to remove old annotations instead.\nIf a detection function declares a label that has no matching label in the task, then by default, BadFunctionError is raised, and auto-annotation is aborted. If you use allow_unmatched_label=True, then such labels will be ignored, and any shapes referring to them will be dropped. Same logic applies to sublabels and attributes.\nIt’s possible to pass a custom confidence threshold to the function via the conf_threshold parameter.\nannotate_task will raise a BadFunctionError exception if it detects that the function violated the detection function protocol.\nPredefined AA functions This layer includes several predefined detection functions. You can use them as-is, or as a base on which to build your own.\nThese AA functions use models from the the torchvision library. To use them, install CVAT SDK with the pytorch extra:\n$ pip install \"cvat-sdk[pytorch]\" Each function is implemented as a dedicated module to allow usage via the CLI auto-annotate command.\nUsage from Python:\nfrom cvat_sdk.auto_annotation.functions.torchvision_\u003ctask\u003e import create as create_torchvision annotate_task(\u003cclient\u003e, \u003ctask ID\u003e, create_torchvision(\u003cmodel name\u003e, ...)) Usage from the CLI:\ncvat-cli auto-annotate \"\u003ctask ID\u003e\" \\ --function-module \"cvat_sdk.auto_annotation.functions.torchvision_\u003ctask\u003e\" \\ -p model_name=str:\"\u003cmodel name\u003e\" ... The create function in each module accepts the following parameters:\nmodel_name (str) - the name of the model, such as fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn_v2. This parameter is required. weights_name (str) - the name of a weights enum value for the model, such as COCO_V1. Defaults to DEFAULT. It also accepts arbitrary additional parameters, which are passed directly to the model constructor.\nThe following section describe each available function.\ncvat_sdk.auto_annotation.function.torchvision_classification This AA function uses torchvision’s classification models. It produces tag annotations. For each frame, the function will output one tag whose label has the highest probability, as long as that probability is greater or equal to the input confidence threshold. If it is lower, the function will output nothing.\ncvat_sdk.auto_annotation.functions.torchvision_detection This AA function uses torchvision’s object detection models. It produces rectangle annotations.\ncvat_sdk.auto_annotation.functions.torchvision_instance_segmentation This AA function uses torchvision’s instance segmentation models. It produces mask or polygon annotations (depending on the value of conv_mask_to_poly).\ncvat_sdk.auto_annotation.functions.torchvision_keypoint_detection This AA function uses torchvision’s keypoint detection models. It produces skeleton annotations. Keypoints which the model marks as invisible will be marked as occluded in CVAT.\nAdditional AA functions The CVAT source repository contains additional predefined auto-annotation functions that are built on top of other computer vision libraries.\nThe following libraries and models are currently covered:\nHugging Face Transformers: all models that are usable with the image classification, object detection and image segmentation pipelines. Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). Ultralytics: all numbered YOLO models (YOLOv3, YOLOv5, and so on).

Each point functions as an individual object, possessing unique attributes and properties like color, occlusion, and visibility.\nSkeletons can be exported in two formats: CVAT for image and COCO Keypoints.\nNote Skeletons’ labels cannot be imported in a label-less project by importing a dataset. You need to define the labels manually before the import. See:\nAdding Skeleton manually Skeleton Configurator Configuring Skeleton points Adding Skeleton labels manually Adding Skeleton labels from the model Annotation with Skeletons Automatic annotation with Skeletons Editing skeletons on the canvas Editing skeletons on the sidebar Adding Skeleton manually To start annotating using skeletons, you need to set up a Skeleton task in Configurator:\nTo open Configurator, when creating a task, click on the Setup skeleton button if you want to set up the skeleton manually, or From model if you want to add skeleton labels from a model.\nSkeleton Configurator The skeleton Configurator is a tool to build skeletons for annotation. It has the following fields:\nNumber Name Description 1 Upload background image (Optional) Use it to upload a background image, to draw a skeleton on top of it. 2 Add point Use it to add Skeleton points to the Drawing area (8). 3 Click and drag Use it to move points across the Drawing area (8). 4 Add edge Use it to add edge on the Drawing area (8) to connect the points (2). 5 Remove point Use it to remove points. Click on Remove point and then on any point (2) on the Drawing area (8) to delete the point. 6 Download skeleton Use it to download created skeleton in .SVG format. 7 Upload skeleton Use it to upload skeleton in .SVG format. 8 Drawing area Use it as a canvas to draw a skeleton. Configuring Skeleton points You can name labels, set attributes, and change the color of each point of the skeleton.\nTo do this, right-click on the skeleton point and select Configure:\nIn the opened menu, you can change the point setting. It is similar to adding labels and attributes of the regular task:\nA Skeleton point can only exist within its parent Skeleton.\nNote You cannot change the skeleton configuration for an existing task/project.\nYou can copy/insert skeleton configuration from the Raw tab of the label configurator.\nAdding Skeleton labels manually To create the Skeleton task, do the following:\nOpen Configurator. (Optional) Upload background image. In the Label name field, enter the name of the label. (Optional) Add attribute Note: you can add attributes exclusively to each point, for more information, see Configuring Skeleton points Use Add point to add points to the Drawing area. Use Add edge to add edges between points. Upload files. Click: Submit \u0026 Open to create and open the task. Submit \u0026 Continue to submit the configuration and start creating a new task. Adding Skeleton labels from the model To add points from the model, and annotate do the following:\nOpen Basic configurator.\nOn the Constructor tab, click From model.\nFrom the Select a model to pick labels select the Human pose estimation model or others if available.\nClick on the model’s labels, you want to use. Selected labels will become gray.\n(Optional) If you want to adjust labels, within the label, click the Update attributes icon. The Skeleton configurator will open, where you can configure the skeleton. Note: Labels cannot be adjusted after the task/project is created.\nClick Done. The labels, that you selected, will appear in the labels window.\nUpload data.\nClick:\nSubmit \u0026 Open to create and open the task. Submit \u0026 Continue to submit the configuration and start creating a new task. Annotation with Skeletons To annotate with Skeleton, do the following\nOpen job.\nOn the tools panel select Draw new skeleton.\nSelect Track to annotate with tracking or Shape to annotate without tracking.\nDraw a skeleton on the image.\nAutomatic annotation with Skeletons To automatically annotate with Skeleton, do the following\nOpen the job and on the tools panel select AI Tools \u003e Detectors\nFrom the drop-down list select the model. You will see a list of points to match and the name of the skeleton on the top of the list.\n(Optional) By clicking on the Bin icon, you can remove any mapped item:\nA skeleton together with all points. Certain points from two mapped skeletons. Click Annotate.\nEditing skeletons on the canvas A drawn skeleton is encompassed within a bounding box, it allows you to manipulate the skeleton as a regular bounding box, enabling actions such as dragging, resizing, or rotating:\nUpon repositioning a point, the bounding box adjusts automatically, without affecting other points:\nAdditionally, Shortcuts are applicable to both the skeleton as a whole and its elements:\nTo use a shortcut to the entire skeleton, hover over the bounding box and push the shortcut keyboard key. This action is applicable for shortcuts like the lock, occluded, pinned, keyframe, and outside for skeleton tracks. To use a shortcut to a specific skeleton point, hover over the point and push the shortcut keyboard key. The same list of shortcuts is available, with the addition of outside, which is also applicable to individual skeleton shape elements. Editing skeletons on the sidebar In CVAT, the sidebar offers an alternative method for setting up skeleton properties and attributes.\nThis approach is similar to that used for other object types supported by CVAT, but with a few specific alterations:\nAn additional collapsible section is provided for users to view a comprehensive list of skeleton parts.\nSkeleton points can have properties like Outside, Occluded, and Hidden.\nBoth Outside and Hidden make a skeleton point invisible.\nOutside property is part of annotations. Use it when part of the object is out of frame borders.\nHidden makes a point hidden only for the annotator’s convenience, this property will not be saved between different sessions.\nOccluded keeps the point visible on the frame and usually means that the point is still on a frame, just hidden behind another object.\n","categories":"","description":"Guide to annotating tasks using Skeletons","excerpt":"Guide to annotating tasks using Skeletons","ref":"/docs/annotation/manual-annotation/shapes/skeletons/","tags":"","title":"Annotation with skeletons"},{"body":"Ultralytics YOLO is a format family which consists of four formats:\nDetection Oriented Bounding Box Segmentation Pose Dataset examples:\nDetection Oriented Bounding Boxes Segmentation Pose Ultralytics YOLO export For export of images:\nSupported annotations Detection: Bounding Boxes Oriented bounding box: Oriented Bounding Boxes Segmentation: Polygons, Masks Pose: Skeletons Attributes: Not supported.

It can be achieved by dividing x coordinates and widths by image width, and y coordinates and heights by image height.\nNote In CVAT you can place an object or some parts of it outside the image, which will cause the coordinates to be outside the [0, 1] range. YOLOv8 framework ignores labels with such coordinates. Each annotation file, with the .txt extension, is named to correspond with its associated image file.\nFor example, frame_000001.txt serves as the annotation for the frame_000001.jpg image.\nTrack support Tracks can be saved on export for Detection by using Ultralytics YOLO Detection Track format.

To authenticate using this method, you need an access token that can be created and configured in the user settings section in the UI. It is the recommended authentication option for CVAT API interaction and integrations.\nCompared to the other authentication options, PATs provide a more convenient, controlled, and secure way to authenticate requests from the CLI, scripts, and 3rd-party applications. They improve the security of your account by allowing you to use separate credentials for each application and by removing the need to use the password. Tokens can be created and revoked at any time by a user request. The security is further improved by configuring the allowed operations and setting expiration dates for each token.\nWarning Please take special care to store the tokens securely. While CVAT takes extra steps to improve the security of the tokens, their security is primarily the user’s responsibility. It’s recommended to configure each token to only allow the required operations and to have an expiration date. Avoid sharing your tokens with other people. If you think a token might have been leaked, revoke the token immediately. How to manage Personal Access Tokens It’s possible to create, edit, and revoke tokens. The tokens can be created, edited, and revoked at any time by a user request. You can configure the name, expiration date, and permissions for each token.\nIt’s recommended to always specify the expiration date for tokens. Please note that unused tokens are automatically considered “stale” and removed after some time period of inactivity (1 year by default).\nNote When using a self-hosted version, the staleness period can be configured via the ACCESS_TOKEN_STALE_PERIOD setting. Note When using a self-hosted version, the maximum number of tokens per user can be configured via the MAX_ACCESS_TOKENS_PER_USER setting. Note CVAT Online users can have up to 50 Personal Access Tokens. Permissions It’s possible to configure allowed operations for a token. Currently, there is an option to make a token read-only or read/write capable. A read-only token will only be allowed to make safe requests that do not modify the server state.\nWarning For security reasons, token-authenticated clients are not allowed to modify tokens and user details, regardless of the configuration. How to create a Personal Access Token Open the user settings page Navigate to the “Security” section Create a new token using the “+” button Configure the name, expiration date, and permissions for the new token. Once ready, click “Save”. You will be shown the new token. Make sure to securely save this value, it will not be available in CVAT after the dialog window is closed. Once the value is saved, close the dialog window. The new token is ready for use.\nHow to edit a Personal Access Token Open the user settings page Navigate to the “Security” section Click the “Edit” button for the token. The token editing page will be displayed. Here you can configure token name, permissions, and expiration date. After the required changes are made, click the “Update” button to confirm the updates. How to revoke Personal Access Tokens Revocation allows you to prevent further uses of a token. Once a token is revoked, it cannot be restored.\nOpen the user settings page Navigate to the “Security” section Click the “Revoke” button for the token. Confirm revocation in the dialog The token will not be available for use anymore.\nHow to use Personal Access Tokens Once you have a Personal Access Token, it can be used for authentication in CVAT.\nTo authenticate a server HTTP API request with a token, the Authorization header must be specified. The value has to include the Bearer prefix: Authorization: Bearer token_value.\nExample: sending a request via the requests Python library\nimport requests token = \"...\" response = requests.get( \"https://app.cvat.ai/api/tasks\", headers={\"Authorization\": \"Bearer \" + token} ) print(response.json()[\"results\"]) Personal Access Tokens can also be used for authentication in other CVAT components:\nin the low-level and high-level API of the CVAT SDK in the CVAT CLI ","categories":"","description":"Use access tokens for enhanced security when integrating with CVAT API","excerpt":"Use access tokens for enhanced security when integrating with CVAT API","ref":"/docs/api_sdk/access_tokens/","tags":"","title":"Access Tokens"},{"body":"Properties Name Type Description Notes id int [optional] [readonly] name str A free-form name for the token.

This streamlines workflows by enabling mass updates, such as changing an assignee or state for a group of jobs, without needing to update each resource individually.\nSupported Resources Jobs Tasks Projects Cloud storages Requests Models Webhooks Organization members Typical Bulk Actions Update Assignee: Assign a new user to multiple jobs, tasks, or projects. Update State/Stage: Change the status or stage for a group of jobs. Delete: Remove multiple resources in one operation. Other field updates: Depending on resource type, other fields may be updated in bulk. How It Works Selection: Select multiple resources using selection tools in the UI. Ctrl (Cmd for Mac) + Click: Select or deselect individual resources by holding the Ctrl key and clicking on them. Shift + Click: Select a range of resources by clicking the first item, holding Shift, and clicking the last item in the range. Select All Button: Use the “Select All” button in the top bar to select all resources on the current page. Click: Click anywhere outside the selected resources to reset the selection. Note Selection is limited to visible resources according to the current page size, filtering, and sorting options. It’s important to adjust filters or sorting before selection to bring them into view. Changing the page clears all selected resources. Action Menu: Once resources are selected, you can either right-click on any of them or left-click the actions menu of a selected resource. An actions appears, offering bulk operations relevant to that resource type. Execution: The chosen action is applied to all selected resources. Progress and status messages are shown for each item. Error Handling: If an operation fails for some items, the system provides feedback and allows retrying the failed items.

Examples: Exclude all files from subfolder ‘sub/sub_1/sub_2’and single file ‘sub/image.jpg’ from specified folder: server_files = [‘sub/’], server_files_exclude = [‘sub/sub_1/sub_2/’, ‘sub/image.jpg’] Exclude all cloud storage files with prefix ‘sub’ from the content of manifest file: server_files = [‘manifest.jsonl’], server_files_exclude = [‘sub/’] [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of [] cloud_storage_id int, none_type If not null, the files referenced by server_files will be retrieved from the cloud storage with the specified ID. The cloud storages applicable depend on the context. In the user sandbox, only the user sandbox cloud storages can be used. In an organization, only the organization cloud storages can be used.

Supports fnmatch wildcards. Read more: https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html [optional] job_file_mapping [[str]] Represents a file-to-job mapping. Useful to specify a custom job configuration during task creation. This option is not compatible with most other job split-related options. Files in the jobs must not overlap or repeat. Job file mapping files must be a subset of the input files. If directories are specified in server_files, all files obtained by recursive search in the specified directories will be used as input files. In case of missing items in the input files, an error will be raised. Example: [ [\"file1.jpg\", \"file2.jpg\"], # job #1 files [\"file3.png\"], # job #2 files [\"file4.jpg\", \"file5.png\", \"file6.bmp\"], # job #3 files ] [optional] upload_file_order [str] Allows to specify file order for client_file uploads. Only valid with the \"predefined\" sorting method selected. To state that the input files are sent in the correct order, pass an empty list. If you want to send files in an arbitrary order and reorder them afterwards on the server, pass the list of file names in the required order.

We store only sources in the repository. To get the full package, one need to generate missing package files.\nLayout of the cvat-sdk directory gen/ - generator files cvat_sdk/ - Python package root cvat_sdk/api_client - autogenerated low-level package code cvat_sdk/core - high-level package code How to generate package code Install generator dependencies:\npip install -r cvat-sdk/gen/requirements.txt Generate package code (call from the package root directory!):\n./cvat-sdk/gen/generate.sh Install the packages:\npip install ./cvat-sdk ./cvat-cli If you want to edit package files, install them with -e:\npip install -e ./cvat-sdk -e ./cvat-cli How to edit templates If you want to edit templates, obtain them from the generator first:\ndocker run --rm -v $PWD:/local \\ openapitools/openapi-generator-cli author template \\ -o /local/generator_templates -g python Then, you can copy the modified version of the template you need into the gen/templates/openapi-generator/ directory.\nRelevant links:\nGenerator implementation, available variables in templates Mustache syntax in the generator How to test API client tests are integrated into REST API tests in /tests/python/rest_api and SDK tests are placed next to them in /tests/python/sdk. To execute, run:\npytest tests/python/rest_api tests/python/sdk SDK API design decisions The generated ApiClient code is modified from what openapi-generator does by default. Changes are mostly focused on better user experience - including better usage patterns and simpler/faster ways to achieve results.\nModifications Added Python type annotations for return types and class members. This change required us to implement a custom post-processing script, which converts generated types into correct type annotations. The types generated by default are supposed to work with the API implementation (parameter validation and parsing), but they are not applicable as type annotations (they have incorrect syntax). Custom post-processing allowed us to make these types correct type annotations. Other possible solutions:\nThere is the python-experimental API generator, which may solve some issues, but it is unstable and requires python 3.9. Our API works with 3.7, which is the lowest supported version now. Custom templates - partially works, but only in limited cases (model fields). It’s very hard to maintain the template code and logic for this. Only if checks and for loops are available in mustache templates, which is not enough for annotation generation. Separate APIs are embedded into the general APIClient class. Now we have:\nwith ApiClient(config) as api_client: result1 = api_client.foo_api.operation1() result2 = api_client.bar_api.operation2() This showed to be more convenient than the default:\nwith ApiClient(config) as api_client: foo_api = FooApi(api_client) result1 = foo_api.operation1() result2 = foo_api.operation2() bar_api = BarApi(api_client) result3 = bar_api.operation3() result4 = bar_api.operation4() This also required custom post-processing. Operation Ids are supposed to be unique in the OpenAPI / Swagger specification. Therefore, we can’t generate such schema on the server, nor we can’t expect it to be supported in the API generator.\nOperations have IDs like \u003capi\u003e/\u003cmethod\u003e_\u003cobject\u003e. This also showed to be more readable and more natural than DRF-spectacular’s default \u003capi\u003e/\u003cobject\u003e_\u003cmethod\u003e.\nServer operations have different types for input and output values. While it can be expected that an endpoint with POST/PUT methods available (like create or partial_update) has the same type for input and output (because it looks natural), it also leads to the situation, in which there are lots of read-/write-only fields, and it becomes hard for understanding. This clear type separation is supposed to make it simpler for users.\nAdded cookie management in the ApiClient class.\nAdded interface classes for models to simplify class member usage and lookup.\nDicts can be passed into API methods and model constructors instead of models. They are automatically parsed as models. In the original implementation, the user is required to pass a Configuration object each time, which is clumsy and adds little sense.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Overview This package contains manually written and autogenerated …","ref":"/docs/api_sdk/sdk/developer-guide/","tags":"","title":"Developer guide"},{"body":"Properties Name Type Description Notes scope str timestamp datetime obj_name str, none_type [optional] obj_id int, none_type [optional] obj_val str, none_type [optional] source str, none_type [optional] count int, none_type [optional] duration int [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of 0 project_id int, none_type [optional] task_id int, none_type [optional] job_id int, none_type [optional] user_id int, none_type [optional] user_name str, none_type [optional] user_email str, none_type [optional] org_id int, none_type [optional] org_slug str, none_type [optional] payload str, none_type [optional] ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Properties Name Type Description Notes scope str timestamp datetime …","ref":"/docs/api_sdk/sdk/reference/models/event/","tags":"","title":"Event class reference"},{"body":"Properties Name Type Description Notes scope str timestamp datetime obj_name str, none_type [optional] obj_id int, none_type [optional] obj_val str, none_type [optional] source str, none_type [optional] count int, none_type [optional] duration int [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of 0 project_id int, none_type [optional] task_id int, none_type [optional] job_id int, none_type [optional] user_id int, none_type [optional] user_name str, none_type [optional] user_email str, none_type [optional] org_id int, none_type [optional] org_slug str, none_type [optional] payload str, none_type [optional] ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Properties Name Type Description Notes scope str timestamp datetime …","ref":"/docs/api_sdk/sdk/reference/models/event-request/","tags":"","title":"EventRequest class reference"},{"body":"Properties Name Type Description Notes webhook_type WebhookType events [EventsEnum] ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Properties Name Type Description Notes webhook_type WebhookType events …","ref":"/docs/api_sdk/sdk/reference/models/events/","tags":"","title":"Events class reference"},{"body":"All URIs are relative to http://localhost\nMethod HTTP request Description create POST /api/events Log client events create_export POST /api/events/export Initiate a process to export events list GET /api/events Get an event log create create( client_events_request, x_organization=None, org=None, org_id=None, **kwargs )\nLog client events\nSends logs to the Clickhouse if it is connected\nExample from pprint import pprint from cvat_sdk.api_client import Configuration, ApiClient, exceptions from cvat_sdk.api_client.models import * # Set up an API client # Read Configuration class docs for more info about parameters and authentication methods configuration = Configuration( host = \"http://localhost\", username = 'YOUR_USERNAME', password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD', ) with ApiClient(configuration) as api_client: client_events_request = ClientEventsRequest( events=[ EventRequest( scope=\"scope_example\", obj_name=\"obj_name_example\", obj_id=1, obj_val=\"obj_val_example\", source=\"source_example\", timestamp=dateutil_parser('1970-01-01T00:00:00.00Z'), count=1, duration=0, project_id=1, task_id=1, job_id=1, user_id=1, user_name=\"user_name_example\", user_email=\"user_email_example\", org_id=1, org_slug=\"org_slug_example\", payload=\"payload_example\", ), ], previous_event=ClientEventsRequestPreviousEvent(None), timestamp=dateutil_parser('1970-01-01T00:00:00.00Z'), ) # ClientEventsRequest | x_organization = \"X-Organization_example\" # str | Organization unique slug (optional) org = \"org_example\" # str | Organization unique slug (optional) org_id = 1 # int | Organization identifier (optional) try: (data, response) = api_client.events_api.create( client_events_request, x_organization=x_organization, org=org, org_id=org_id, ) pprint(data) except exceptions.ApiException as e: print(\"Exception when calling EventsApi.create(): %s\\n\" % e) Parameters Name Type Description Notes client_events_request ClientEventsRequest x_organization str Organization unique slug [optional] org str Organization unique slug [optional] org_id int Organization identifier [optional] There are also optional kwargs that control the function invocation behavior.

If you did, make sure all containers are stopped by docker compose down. To bring up cvat with auto annotation tool, from cvat root directory, you need to run:\ndocker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f components/serverless/docker-compose.serverless.yml up -d If you did any changes to the Docker Compose files, make sure to add --build at the end.\nTo stop the containers, simply run:\ndocker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f components/serverless/docker-compose.serverless.yml down You have to install nuctl command line tool to build and deploy serverless functions. Download version 1.13.0. It is important that the version you download matches the version in docker-compose.serverless.yml. For example, using wget.\nwget https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio/releases/download/\u003cversion\u003e/nuctl-\u003cversion\u003e-linux-amd64 After downloading the nuclio, give it a proper permission and do a softlink.\nsudo chmod +x nuctl-\u003cversion\u003e-linux-amd64 sudo ln -sf $(pwd)/nuctl-\u003cversion\u003e-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/nuctl Deploy a couple of functions. This will automatically create a cvat Nuclio project to contain the functions. Commands below should be run only after CVAT has been installed using docker compose because it runs nuclio dashboard which manages all serverless functions.\n./serverless/deploy_cpu.sh serverless/openvino/dextr ./serverless/deploy_cpu.sh serverless/openvino/omz/public/yolo-v3-tf GPU Support You will need to install Nvidia Container Toolkit. Also you will need to add --resource-limit nvidia.com/gpu=1 --triggers '{\"myHttpTrigger\": {\"maxWorkers\": 1}}' to the nuclio deployment command. You can increase the maxWorker if you have enough GPU memory. As an example, below will run on the GPU:\nnuctl deploy --project-name cvat \\ --path serverless/tensorflow/matterport/mask_rcnn/nuclio \\ --platform local --base-image tensorflow/tensorflow:1.15.5-gpu-py3 \\ --desc \"GPU based implementation of Mask RCNN on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow.\" \\ --image cvat/tf.matterport.mask_rcnn_gpu \\ --triggers '{\"myHttpTrigger\": {\"maxWorkers\": 1}}' \\ --resource-limit nvidia.com/gpu=1 Note:\nThe number of GPU deployed functions will be limited to your GPU memory. See deploy_gpu.sh script for more examples. For some models (namely SiamMask) you need an Nvidia driver version greater than or equal to 450.80.02. Note for Windows users:\nIf you want to use nuclio under Windows CVAT installation you should install Nvidia drivers for WSL according to this instruction and follow the steps up to “2.3 Installing Nvidia drivers”. Important requirement: you should have the latest versions of Docker Desktop, Nvidia drivers for WSL, and the latest updates from the Windows Insider Preview Dev channel.\nTroubleshooting Nuclio Functions:\nYou can open nuclio dashboard at localhost:8070. Make sure status of your functions are up and running without any error.\nTest your deployed DL model as a serverless function.

Supports the TUS open file uploading protocol (https://tus.io/). Supports the following protocols: 1. A single Data request and 2.1. An Upload-Start request 2.2.a. Regular TUS protocol requests (Upload-Length + Chunks) 2.2.b. Upload-Multiple requests 2.3. An Upload-Finish request Requests: - Data - POST, no extra headers or ‘Upload-Start’ + ‘Upload-Finish’ headers. Contains data in the body. - Upload-Start - POST, has an ‘Upload-Start’ header. No body is expected. - Upload-Length - POST, has an ‘Upload-Length’ header (see the TUS specification) - Chunk - HEAD/PATCH (see the TUS specification). Sent to /data/ endpoints. - Upload-Finish - POST, has an ‘Upload-Finish’ header. Can contain data in the body. - Upload-Multiple - POST, has an ‘Upload-Multiple’ header. Contains data in the body. The ‘Upload-Finish’ request allows to specify the uploaded files should be ordered. This may be needed if the files can be sent unordered. To state that the input files are sent ordered, pass an empty list of files in the ‘upload_file_order’ field. If the files are sent unordered, the ordered file list is expected in the ‘upload_file_order’ field. It must be a list of string file paths, relative to the dataset root. Example: files = [ \"cats/cat_1.jpg\", \"dogs/dog2.jpg\", \"image_3.png\", … ] Independently of the file declaration field used (‘client_files’, ‘server_files’, etc.), when the ‘predefined’ sorting method is selected, the uploaded files will be ordered according to the ‘.jsonl’ manifest file, if it is found in the list of files. For archives (e.g. ‘.zip’), a manifest file (’*.jsonl’) is required when using the ‘predefined’ file ordering. Such file must be provided next to the archive in the list of files. Read more about manifest files here: https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/manual/advanced/dataset_manifest/ After all data is sent, the operation status can be retrieved via the GET /api/requests/\u003crq_id\u003e, where rq_id is request ID returned for this request.

Negative points define the area in which the object is not located. AI tools: annotate with interactors To annotate with interactors, do the following:\nClick Magic wand , and go to the Interactors tab. From the Label drop-down, select a label for the polygon. From the Interactor drop-down, select a model (see Interactors models). Click the Question mark to see information about each model: (Optional) If the model returns masks, and you need to convert masks to polygons, use the Convert masks to polygons toggle. Click Interact. Use the left click to add positive points and the right click to add negative points. Number of points you can add depends on the model. On the top menu, click Done (or Shift+N, N). AI tools: add extra points Note More points improve outline accuracy, but make shape editing harder. Fewer points make shape editing easier, but reduce outline accuracy. Each model has a minimum required number of points for annotation. Once the required number of points is reached, the request is automatically sent to the server. The server processes the request and adds a polygon to the frame.\nFor a more accurate outline, postpone request to finish adding extra points first:\nHold down the Ctrl key. On the top panel, the Block button will turn blue. Add points to the image. Release the Ctrl key, when ready. In case you used Mask to polygon when the object is finished, you can edit it like a polygon.\nYou can change the number of points in the polygon with the slider:\nAI tools: delete points To delete a point, do the following:\nWith the cursor, hover over the point you want to delete. If the point can be deleted, it will enlarge and the cursor will turn into a cross. Left-click on the point. OpenCV: intelligent scissors To use Intelligent scissors, do the following:\nOn the menu toolbar, click OpenCV and wait for the library to load.\nGo to the Drawing tab, select the label, and click on the Intelligent scissors button.\nAdd the first point on the boundary of the allocated object. You will see a line repeating the outline of the object.\nAdd the second point, so that the previous point is within the restrictive threshold. After that a line repeating the object boundary will be automatically created between the points. To finish placing points, on the top menu click Done (or N on the keyboard).\nAs a result, a polygon will be created.\nYou can change the number of points in the polygon with the slider:\nTo increase or lower the action threshold, hold Ctrl and scroll the mouse wheel.\nDuring the drawing process, you can remove the last point by clicking on it with the left mouse button.\nSettings On how to adjust the polygon, see Objects sidebar.\nFor more information about polygons in general, see Annotation with polygons.\nInteractors models Model Tool Description Example Segment Anything Model (SAM) AI Tools The Segment Anything Model (SAM) produces high quality object masks, and it can be used to generate masks for all objects in an image. It has been trained on a dataset of 11 million images and 1.1 billion masks, and has strong zero-shot performance on a variety of segmentation tasks. For more information, see: GitHub: Segment Anything Site: Segment AnythingPaper: Segment Anything Deep extreme cut (DEXTR) AI Tool This is an optimized version of the original model, introduced at the end of 2017. It uses the information about extreme points of an object to get its mask. The mask is then converted to a polygon. For now this is the fastest interactor on the CPU. For more information, see: GitHub: DEXTR-PyTorch Site: DEXTR-PyTorchPaper: DEXTR-PyTorch Inside-Outside-Guidance\n(IOG) AI Tool The model uses a bounding box and inside/outside points to create a mask. First of all, you need to create a bounding\nbox, wrapping the object. Then you need to use positive and negative points to say the model where is a foreground, and where is a background.\nNegative points are optional. For more information, see: GitHub: IOG Paper: IOG Intelligent scissors OpenCV Intelligent scissors is a CV method of creating a polygon by placing points with the automatic drawing of a line between them. The distance\nbetween the adjacent points is limited by the threshold of action, displayed as a red square that is tied to the cursor. For more information, see: Site: Intelligent Scissors Specification Detectors Detectors are a part of AI tools.\nUse detectors to automatically identify and locate objects in images or videos.\nLabels matching Each model is trained on a dataset and supports only the dataset’s labels.\nFor example:\nDL model has the label car. Your task (or project) has the label vehicle. To annotate, you need to match these two labels to give DL model a hint, that in this case car = vehicle.\nIf you have a label that is not on the list of DL labels, you will not be able to match them.\nFor this reason, supported DL models are suitable only for certain labels. To check the list of labels for each model, see Detectors models.\nAnnotate with detectors To annotate with detectors, do the following:\nClick Magic wand , and go to the Detectors tab.\nFrom the Model drop-down, select model (see Detectors models).\nFrom the left drop-down select the DL model label, from the right drop-down select the matching label of your task.\n(Optional) If the model returns masks, and you need to convert masks to polygons, use the Convert masks to polygons toggle.\n(Optional) You can specify a Threshold for the model. If not provided, the default value from the model settings will be used.\nClick Annotate.\nThis action will automatically annotate one frame. For automatic annotation of multiple frames, see Automatic annotation.\nDetectors models Model Description Mask RCNN The model generates polygons for each instance of an object in the image. For more information, see: GitHub: Mask RCNN Paper: Mask RCNN Faster RCNN The model generates bounding boxes for each instance of an object in the image. In this model, RPN and Fast R-CNN are combined into a single network.

For more information, see: Site: Face Detection 0205 Trackers Trackers are part of AI and OpenCV tools.\nUse trackers to identify and label objects in a video or image sequence that are moving or changing over time.\nAI tools: annotate with trackers To annotate with trackers, do the following:\nClick Magic wand , and go to the Trackers tab.\nFrom the Label drop-down, select the label for the object.\nFrom Tracker drop-down, select tracker.\nClick Track, and annotate the objects with the bounding box in the first frame.\nGo to the top menu and click Next (or the F on the keyboard) to move to the next frame. All annotated objects will be automatically tracked.\nWhen tracking To enable/disable tracking, use Tracker switcher on the sidebar.\nTrackable objects have an indication on canvas with a model name.\nYou can follow the tracking by the messages appearing at the top.\nOpenCV: annotate with trackers To annotate with trackers, do the following:\nCreate basic rectangle shapes or tracks for tracker initialization\nOn the menu toolbar, click OpenCV and wait for the library to load.\nFrom Tracker drop-down, select tracker and Click Track\nAnnotation actions window will pop-up. Setup Target frame and Convert rectangle shapes to tracks parameters and click Run\nNote Tracking will be applied to all filtered rectangle annotations. All annotated objects will be automatically tracked up until target frame parameter.\nTrackers models Model Tool Description Example TrackerMIL OpenCV TrackerMIL model is not bound to labels and can be used for any object. It is a fast client-side model designed to track simple non-overlapping objects. For more information, see: Article: Object Tracking using OpenCV SiamMask AI Tools Fast online Object Tracking and Segmentation. The trackable object will be tracked automatically if the previous frame was the latest keyframe for the object. For more information, see: GitHub: SiamMask Paper: SiamMask Transformer Tracking (TransT) AI Tools Simple and efficient online tool for object tracking and segmentation. If the previous frame was the latest keyframe for the object, the trackable object will be tracked automatically.\nThis is a modified version of the PyTracking Python framework based on Pytorch\nFor more information, see: GitHub: TransT Paper: TransT SAM2 Tracker AI Agent Advanced object tracking and segmentation using Meta’s Segment Anything Model 2.

Click on Histogram equalization button. Histogram equalization will improve contrast on current and following frames.\nExample of the result:\nTo disable Histogram equalization, click on the button again.\n","categories":"","description":"Overview of semi-automatic and automatic annotation tools available in CVAT.","excerpt":"Overview of semi-automatic and automatic annotation tools available in …","ref":"/docs/annotation/auto-annotation/ai-tools/","tags":"","title":"AI Tools"},{"body":"ICDAR 13/15 formats are typically used for text detection and recognition tasks and OCR (Optical Character Recognition).\nThese formats are usually paired with specialized text detection and recognition models.\nFor more information, see:\nICDAR13/15 Dataset examples ICDAR13/15 export ICDAR Recognition 1.0 (Text recognition): Supported annotations: Tags with the icdar label Attributes: caption.

Currently, it uses the following triggers to send events:\nPeriodical timer (~90 seconds) A user clicks the “Save” button on the annotation view A user opens the annotation view A user closes the annotation view (but not the tab/browser) A user clicks Logout button When events reach the server, it calculates working time based on timestamps of the events.\nThe working time for an event is computed as the sum of the following:\nThe difference between the start time of the event and the end time of the previous event, if it is not more than 100 seconds. The duration of the event, for events of type change:frame. After calculation, the server generates send:working_time events with time value in payload. These events may or may not be bound to a certain job/task/project, depending on the client-side events that were used to generate them.\nCVAT saves the event in the database and later these events are used to compute metrics for analytics.\nRequest id for tracking Note, that every response to an API request made to the the server includes a header named X-Request-Id, for example: X-Request-Id: 6a2b7102-c4b9-4d57-8754-5658132ba37d.\nThis identifier is also recorded in all server events that occur as a result of the respective request.\nFor example, when an operation to create a task is performed, other related entities such as labels and attributes are generated on the server in addition to the Task object.\nAll events associated with this operation will have the same request_id in the payload field.\nExport event data You can export the event data as a CSV file locally and to cloud storage.\nTo export the data locally:\nInitiate the export process by sending a POST request to /api/events/export endpoint. The endpoint accepts several query parameters to filter events: org_id, project_id, task_id, job_id, user_id, to and from. For more details, see Swagger API Documentation. For example:\ncurl -X POST -u 'user:pass' https://app.cvat.ai/api/events/export?job_id=123 You can check the status of the export process by sending a GET request with the rq_id to the /api/requests/{id} endpoint:\ncurl -I --user 'user:pass' https://app.cvat.ai/api/requests/rq_id Once the export process finishes, the request returns an object with \"status\": \"finished\" and \"result_url\": \"URL\".\nDownload the event data file locally using result_url:\ncurl -u user:password -o path/to/file.csv result_url This command will download and save the CSV file to path/to/file.csv on your local machine.\nTo save the CSV file with the event data to cloud storage, you can use the /api/events/export endpoint with cloud_storage_id and location=cloud_storage parameters, for example:\ncurl -X POST -u user:password \"https://app.cvat.ai/api/events/export?cloud_storage_id=your_cloud_storage_id\u0026location=cloud_storage\" Dashboards By default, three dashboards are available in CVAT.\nTo access them, click General, you will be forwarded to the page with available dashboards.\nDashboard Description All Events Dashboard that shows all event logs, timestamps, and source.

CVAT allows to use different data sources, including local file uploads, a mounted file share on the server, cloud storages and remote URLs. In some cases CVAT needs to have extra information about the input data. This information can be provided in Dataset manifest files. They are mainly used when working with cloud storages to reduce the amount of network traffic used and speed up the task creation process. However, they can also be used in other cases, which will be explained below.\nA dataset manifest file is a text file in the JSONL format. These files can be created automatically with the special command-line tool, or manually, following the manifest file format specification.\nHow and when to use manifest files Manifest files can be used in the following cases:\nA video file or a set of images is used as the data source and the caching mode is enabled. Read more The data is located in a cloud storage. Read more The predefined file sorting method is specified. Read more The predefined sorting method Independently of the file source being used, when the predefined sorting method is selected in the task configuration, the source files will be ordered according to the .jsonl manifest file, if it is found in the input list of files. If a manifest is not found, the order provided in the input file list is used.\nFor image archives (e.g. .zip), a manifest file (*.jsonl) is required when using the predefined file ordering. A manifest file must be provided next to the archive in the input list of files, it must not be inside the archive.\nIf there are multiple manifest files in the input file list, an error will be raised.\nHow to generate manifest files CVAT provides a dedicated Python tool to generate manifest files. The source code can be found here.\nUsing the tool is the recommended way to create manifest files for you data. The data must be available locally to the tool to generate manifest.\nUsage usage: create.py [-h] [--force] [--output-dir .] source positional arguments: source Source paths optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --force Use this flag to prepare the manifest file for video data if by default the video does not meet the requirements and a manifest file is not prepared --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR Directory where the manifest file will be saved Use the script from a Docker image This is the recommended way to use the tool.\nThe script can be used from the cvat/server image:\ndocker run -it --rm -u \"$(id -u)\":\"$(id -g)\" \\ -v \"${PWD}\":\"/local\" \\ --entrypoint python3 \\ cvat/server \\ utils/dataset_manifest/create.py --output-dir /local /local/\u003cpath/to/sources\u003e Make sure to adapt the command to your file locations.\nUse the script directly Ubuntu 20.04 Install dependencies:\n# General sudo apt-get update \u0026\u0026 sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install -y \\ python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv pkg-config # Library components sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y \\ libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev \\ libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libswresample-dev libavfilter-dev Create an environment and install the necessary python modules:\npython3 -m venv .env . .env/bin/activate pip install -U pip pip install -r utils/dataset_manifest/requirements.in Note Please note that if used with video this way, the results may be different from what would the server decode. It is related to the ffmpeg library version. For this reason, using the Docker-based version of the tool is recommended. Examples Create a dataset manifest in the current directory with video which contains enough keyframes:\npython utils/dataset_manifest/create.py ~/Documents/video.mp4 Create a dataset manifest with video which does not contain enough keyframes:\npython utils/dataset_manifest/create.py --force --output-dir ~/Documents ~/Documents/video.mp4 Create a dataset manifest with images:\npython utils/dataset_manifest/create.py --output-dir ~/Documents ~/Documents/images/ Create a dataset manifest with pattern (may be used *, ?, []):\npython utils/dataset_manifest/create.py --output-dir ~/Documents \"/home/${USER}/Documents/**/image*.jpeg\" Create a dataset manifest using Docker image:\ndocker run -it --rm -u \"$(id -u)\":\"$(id -g)\" \\ -v ~/Documents/data/:${HOME}/manifest/:rw \\ --entrypoint '/usr/bin/bash' \\ cvat/server \\ utils/dataset_manifest/create.py --output-dir ~/manifest/ ~/manifest/images/ File format The dataset manifest files are text files in JSONL format.

This makes it easy to set up automated processes that respond to changes made in CVAT.\nFor example, you can set up webhooks to alert you when a job’s assignee is changed or when a job/task’s status is updated, for instance, when a job is completed and ready for review or has been reviewed. New task creation can also trigger notifications.\nThese capabilities allow you to keep track of progress and changes in your CVAT workflow instantly.\nIn CVAT you can create a webhook for a project or organization. You can use CVAT GUI or direct API calls.\nSee:\nCreate Webhook For project For organization Webhooks forms List of events Payloads Create event Update event Delete event Webhook secret Ping Webhook Webhooks with API calls Example of setup and use Create Webhook For project To create a webhook for Project, do the following:\nCreate a Project.\nGo to the Projects and click on the project’s widget.\nIn the top right corner, click Actions \u003e Setup Webhooks.\nIn the top right corner click +\nFill in the Setup webhook form and click Submit.\nFor organization To create a webhook for Organization, do the following:\nCreate Organization Go to the Organization \u003e Settings \u003e Actions \u003e Setup Webhooks.

This helps ensure the authenticity of incoming webhook requests.\nWhen a secret is provided, CVAT includes an X-Signature-256 header in the webhook request. This header contains a SHA256 hash of the request body, signed using the secret key.\nHow it works:\nCVAT computes the SHA256 HMAC of the request body using the secret. The computed hash is included in the X-Signature-256 header. The webhook receiver verifies the request by recalculating the hash using the same secret and comparing it with the received signature. Here’s an example of the X-Signature-256 header for a request with an empty body and secret = mykey:\nX-Signature-256: e1b24265bf2e0b20c81837993b4f1415f7b68c503114d100a40601eca6a2745f Verifying webhook signature You can verify the webhook signature in your webhook receiver service using Python:\n# webhook_receiver.py import hmac from hashlib import sha256 from flask import Flask, request app = Flask(__name__) @app.route(\"/webhook\", methods=[\"POST\"]) def webhook(): secret = \"mykey\".encode(\"utf-8\") received_signature = request.headers.get(\"X-Signature-256\", \"\") expected_signature = \"sha256=\" + hmac.new(secret, request.data, digestmod=sha256).hexdigest() if hmac.compare_digest(received_signature, expected_signature): return app.response_class(status=200, response=\"Valid signature\") return app.response_class(status=403, response=\"Invalid Signature\") if __name__ == \"__main__\": app.run(port=5000) Ping webhook The Ping webhook feature helps confirm that CVAT can successfully send webhook events to the configured target URL.\nClick the Ping button in the CVAT UI. Alternatively, send a POST /webhooks/{id}/ping request via the API. CVAT will send a webhook event to the target URL with basic details. Ping webhook payload Key Type Description event string Always set to ping. webhook object Contains webhook details (refer to Swagger docs for a complete structure). sender object Includes information about the user who triggered the ping. Example ping event payload:\n{ \"event\": \"ping\", \"webhook\": { \"id\": 7, \"url\": \"\u003chttp://localhost:8080/api/webhooks/7\u003e\", \"target_url\": \"\u003chttps://example.com\u003e\", \"description\": \"\", \"type\": \"project\", \"content_type\": \"application/json\", \"is_active\": true, \"enable_ssl\": true, \"created_date\": \"2022-10-04T08:05:23.007381Z\", \"updated_date\": \"2022-10-04T08:05:23.007395Z\", \"owner\": { \"url\": \"\u003chttp://localhost:8080/api/users/1\u003e\", \"id\": 1, \"username\": \"admin1\", \"first_name\": \"Admin\", \"last_name\": \"First\" }, \"project\": 7, \"organization\": null, \"events\": \\[ \"create:comment\", \"create:issue\", \"create:task\", \"delete:comment\", \"delete:issue\", \"delete:task\", \"update:comment\", \"update:issue\", \"update:job\", \"update:project\", \"update:task\" \\], \"last_status\": 200, \"last_delivery_date\": \"2022-10-04T11:04:52.538638Z\" }, \"sender\": { \"url\": \"\u003chttp://localhost:8080/api/users/1\u003e\", \"id\": 1, \"username\": \"admin1\", \"first_name\": \"Admin\", \"last_name\": \"First\" } } Webhooks with API calls You can create and manage webhooks via API calls. Refer to the Swagger API documentation for details.\nFor implementation examples, check the REST API tests.\nExample: setting up email alerts via webhooks This video demonstrates configuring email alerts for a project using Zapier and Gmail:\n","categories":"","description":"CVAT Webhooks: set up and use","excerpt":"CVAT Webhooks: set up and use","ref":"/docs/administration/community/advanced/webhooks/","tags":"","title":"Webhooks"},{"body":"CVAT use traefik as a reverse proxy to manage SSL certificates.
