CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) is a leading visual data annotation platform for building high-quality image, video, and 3D datasets for training computer vision models.
It is being developed CVAT.ai team to help AI and machine learning teams annotate millions of objects with different shapes and properties.
Many UI and UX decisions are based on feedbacks from CVAT's in-house professional data annotation team.
