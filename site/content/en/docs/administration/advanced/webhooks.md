Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks that are triggered by specific events.
When an event that triggers a webhook occurs, CVAT makes an HTTP request
to the URL configured for the webhook.
The request will include a payload with information about the event.

CVAT, webhooks can be triggered by a variety of events,
such as the creation, deletion, or modification of tasks,
jobs, and so on.
This makes it easy to set up automated processes
that respond to changes made in CVAT.

For example, you can set up webhooks to alert you when a job's assignee is changed or when
a job/task's status is updated, for instance, when a job is completed and ready for review
or has been reviewed. New task creation can also trigger notifications.

These capabilities allow you to keep track of progress and changes in your CVAT workflow instantly.

In CVAT you can create a webhook for a project or organization.
You can use CVAT GUI or direct API calls.

## Webhook secret

To validate that webhook requests originate from CVAT, include a `secret` during the webhook creation process.
This helps ensure the authenticity of incoming webhook requests.

When a `secret` is provided, CVAT includes an `X-Signature-256` header in the webhook request.
This header contains a SHA256 hash of the request body, signed using the secret key.

How it works:
1. CVAT computes the SHA256 HMAC of the request body using the `secret`.
2. The computed hash is included in the `X-Signature-256` header.
3. The webhook receiver verifies the request by recalculating the hash using the same `secret`
and comparing it with the received signature.

Here’s an example of the `X-Signature-256` header for a request with an empty body and `secret = mykey`:

```
X-Signature-256: e1b24265bf2e0b20c81837993b4f1415f7b68c503114d100a40601eca6a2745f
```

#### Verifying webhook signature
You can verify the webhook signature in your webhook receiver service using Python:

```python
# webhook_receiver.py

import hmac
from hashlib import sha256
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/webhook", methods=["POST"])
def webhook():
    secret = "mykey".encode("utf-8")
    received_signature = request.headers.get("X-Signature-256", "")

    expected_signature = "sha256=" + hmac.new(secret, request.data, digestmod=sha256).hexdigest()

    if hmac.compare_digest(received_signature, expected_signature):
        return app.response_class(status=200, response="Valid signature")
    return app.response_class(status=403, response="Invalid Signature")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(port=5000)
```

## Ping webhook

The **Ping** webhook feature helps confirm that CVAT can successfully send webhook events to the configured target URL.

![Ping Webhook](/images/ping_webhook.jpg)

1. Click the **Ping** button in the CVAT UI. Alternatively, send a `POST /webhooks/{id}/ping` request via the API.
2. CVAT will send a webhook event to the target URL with basic details.

## Webhooks with API calls

You can create and manage webhooks via API calls.
Refer to the [Swagger API documentation](https://app.cvat.ai/api/docs) for details.

For implementation examples, check the [REST API tests](https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/blob/develop/tests/python/rest_api/test_webhooks.py).

## Example: setting up email alerts via webhooks

This video demonstrates configuring email alerts for a project using Zapier and Gmail:
