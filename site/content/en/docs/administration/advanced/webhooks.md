Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks that are triggered by specific events.
When an event that triggers a webhook occurs, CVAT makes an HTTP request
to the URL configured for the webhook.
The request will include a payload with information about the event.

CVAT, webhooks can be triggered by a variety of events,
such as the creation, deletion, or modification of tasks,
jobs, and so on.
This makes it easy to set up automated processes
that respond to changes made in CVAT.

For example, you can set up webhooks to alert you when a job's assignee is changed or when
a job/task's status is updated, for instance, when a job is completed and ready for review
or has been reviewed. New task creation can also trigger notifications.

These capabilities allow you to keep track of progress and changes in your CVAT workflow instantly.

In CVAT you can create a webhook for a project or organization.
You can use CVAT GUI or direct API calls.

## Webhook secret

To validate that the webhook requests originate from CVAT, include a `secret` during the webhook creation process.

When a `secret` is provided for the webhook, CVAT includes an `X-Signature-256` in the request header of the webhook.

CVAT uses the SHA256 hash function to encode the request
body for the webhook and places the resulting hash into the header.

The webhook recipient can verify the source of the request
by comparing the received `X-Signature-256` value with the expected value.

Here's an example of a header value for a request with an empty body and `secret = mykey`:

```
X-Signature-256: e1b24265bf2e0b20c81837993b4f1415f7b68c503114d100a40601eca6a2745f
```

Here is an example of how you can verify a webhook signature in your webhook receiver service:

```python
# webhook_receiver.py

import hmac
from hashlib import sha256
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/webhook", methods=["POST"])
def webhook():
    signature = (
        "sha256="
        + hmac.new("mykey".encode("utf-8"), request.data, digestmod=sha256).hexdigest()
    )

    if hmac.compare_digest(request.headers["X-Signature-256"], signature):
        return app.response_class(status=200)

    raise app.response_class(status=500, response="Signatures didn't match!")
```

## Ping Webhook

To confirm the proper configuration of your webhook and ensure that CVAT can establish
a connection with the target URL, use the **Ping** webhook feature.
