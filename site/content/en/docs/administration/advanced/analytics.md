CVAT Analytics suite of tools is designed to track and understand users' behavior, system performance,
and for identifying potential issues in your application.

You can also visualize user activity through Grafana, and aggregate user
working time by the jobs.

Gathered logs can be additionally filtered for efficient debugging.

By using analytics, you'll gain valuable insights to optimize your system
and enhance user satisfaction.

CVAT analytics are available from the top menu.

## High-level architecture

The CVAT analytics is based on Vector, ClickHouse, and Grafana.

## CVAT Analytics

CVAT and its analytics module can be set up locally, for
self-hosted solution analytics are enabled by default.

> For detailed CVAT installation instructions, see
> {{< ilink "/docs/administration/basics/installation" "Installation Guide" >}}
> or refer to the [CVAT Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0to7Ng4PuuYQT4eXlHb_oIlq_RPeuasN)
> for installation videos.

All analytics-related features will be launched when you
start CVAT containers with the following command:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

### Ports settings

### Types of supported events

Supported events change the scope of information displayed in Grafana.

![Supported Events](/images/supported_events.jpg)

<!--lint disable maximum-line-length-->

Server events:

- `create:project`, `update:project`, `delete:project`

- `create:task`, `update:task`, `delete:task`

- `create:job`, `update:job`, `delete:job`

- `create:organization`, `update:organization`, `delete:organization`

- `create:user`, `update:user`, `delete:user`

- `create:cloudstorage`, `update:cloudstorage`, `delete:cloudstorage`

- `create:issue`, `update:issue`, `delete:issue`

- `create:comment`, `update:comment`, `delete:comment`

- `create:annotations`, `update:annotations`, `delete:annotations`

- `create:label`, `update:label`, `delete:label`

- `export:dataset`, `import:dataset`

Client events:

- `load:cvat`

- `load:job`, `save:job`, `restore:job`
- `upload:annotations`
- `send:exception`
- `send:task_info`

- `draw:object`, `paste:object`, `copy:object`, `propagate:object`, `drag:object`, `resize:object`, `delete:object`, `lock:object`, `merge:objects`
- `change:attribute`
- `change:label`

- `change:frame`
- `zoom:image`, `fit:image`, `rotate:image`

- `action:undo`, `action:redo`

- `press:shortcut`
- `send:debug_info`

- `run:annotations_action`
- `click:element`

<!--lint enable maximum-line-length-->

### Request `id` for tracking

Note, that every response to an API request made to the
the server includes a header named `X-Request-Id`,
for example: `X-Request-Id: 6a2b7102-c4b9-4d57-8754-5658132ba37d`.

This identifier is also recorded in all server events that
occur as a result of the respective request.

For example, when an operation to create a task is performed,
other related entities such as labels and attributes are
generated on the server in addition to the **Task** object.

All events associated with this operation will have the same `request_id` in
the payload field.

### Fetching event data as CSV from the `/api/events` endpoint

<!--lint disable maximum-line-length-->

The `/api/events` endpoint allows the fetching of
event data with filtering parameters such as
`org_id`, `project_id`, `task_id`, `job_id`, and `user_id`.

For more details,
see [Swagger API Documentation](https://app.cvat.ai/api/swagger/#/events/events_list).

For example, to fetch all events associated with a specific job,
the following `curl` command can be used:

```bash
curl --user 'user:pass' https://app.cvat.ai/api/events?job_id=123
```

In the response, you will receive a query ID:

```json
{ "query_id": "150cac1f-09f1-4d73-b6a5-5f47aa5d0031" }
```

As this process may take some time to complete,
the status of the request can be checked by
adding the query parameter `query_id` to the request:

```bash
curl -I --user 'user:pass' https://app.cvat.ai/api/events?job_id=123&query_id=150cac1f-09f1-4d73-b6a5-5f47aa5d0031
```

Upon successful creation, the server will return a `201 Created` status:

```
HTTP/2 201
allow: GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS
date: Tue, 16 May 2023 13:38:42 GMT
referrer-policy: same-origin
server: Apache
vary: Accept,Origin,Cookie
x-content-type-options: nosniff
x-frame-options: DENY
x-request-id: 4631f5fa-a4f0-42a8-b77b-7426fc298a85
```

The CSV file can be downloaded by
adding the `action=download` query parameter to the request:

```bash
curl --user 'user:pass' https://app.cvat.ai/api/events?job_id=123&query_id=150cac1f-09f1-4d73-b6a5-5f47aa5d0031&action=download > /tmp/events.csv
```

This will download and save the file to `/tmp/events.csv`
on your local machine.

## Dashboards

    FROM cvat.events
    WHERE
      user_id IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
      user_id,
      time
    ORDER BY time ASC WITH FILL STEP toIntervalMinute(15)
)
GROUP BY time
ORDER BY time
```
