On the **Jobs** page, users (for example, with the worker role)
can see the jobs that are assigned to them without having access to the task page,
as well as track progress, sort, and apply filters to the job list.

![Jobs page example](/images/image243_detrac.jpg)

On the page, there is a list of jobs presented in the form of tiles, where each tile is one job.
Each element contains:
- job ID
- dimension `2D` or `3D`
- preview
- {{< ilink "/docs/manual/basics/vocabulary#stage" "stage" >}} and
  {{< ilink "/docs/manual/basics/vocabulary#state" "state" >}}
- when hovering over an element, you can see:
  - size
  - assignee
- menu to navigate to a task, project, or bug tracker.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
To open the job in a new tab, click on the job by holding `Ctrl`.
{{% /alert %}}

In the upper left corner, there is a search bar, using which you can find the job by assignee, stage, state, etc.
In the upper right corner, there are {{< ilink "/docs/manual/advanced/filter#sort-by" "sorting" >}},
{{< ilink "/docs/manual/advanced/filter#quick-filters" "quick filters" >}}, and filter.

## Filter

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Applying a filter disables the {{< ilink "/docs/manual/advanced/filter#quick-filters" "quick filter" >}}.
{{% /alert %}}

The filter works similarly to the filters for annotation,
you can create rules from [properties](#supported-properties-for-jobs-list),
{{< ilink "/docs/manual/advanced/filter#supported-operators-for-properties" "operators" >}},
and values and group rules into {{< ilink "/docs/manual/advanced/filter#groups" "groups" >}}.
For more details, consult the {{< ilink "/docs/manual/advanced/filter#create-a-filter" "filter section" >}}.
Learn more about {{< ilink "/docs/manual/advanced/filter#date-and-time-selection" "date and time selection" >}}.

To clear all filters, select `Clear filters`.
