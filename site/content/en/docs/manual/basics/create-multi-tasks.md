   - (Optional) `{{file_name}}` adds the file's name to the task's name.
     > **Note:** use hyphen between three parameters: `Word1 word2 word3 {{index}} {{file_name}}`

2. (Optional) From the **Projects** drop-down, select a project for the tasks.
   <br>Leave this field empty if you do not want to assign tasks to any project.
