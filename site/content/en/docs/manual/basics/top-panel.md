The button to go to the next / previous frame has the customization possibility.
To customize, right-click on the button and select one of three options:

2. Go to the next / previous frame that has any objects (in particular filtered).
   Read the [filter](/docs/manual/advanced/filter/) section to know the details how to use it.
