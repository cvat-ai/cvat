The type of shape can be changed by selecting the **Label** property.
For instance, it can look like shown in the figure below:

**Object action menu**

The action menu calls up the button:

![](/images/image047.jpg)

The action menu contains:

- **Create object URL** - puts a link to an object on the clipboard.
  After you open the link, this object will be filtered.
- **Make a copy** - copies an object. The keyboard shortcut is **Ctrl** + **C** > **Ctrl** + **V**.
- **Propagate** function copies the form to multiple frames
  and displays a dialog box where you can specify the number
  of copies or the frame to which you want to copy the object.
  The keyboard shortcut is **Ctr**l + **B**. <br>There are two options available:

  - **Propagate forward** (![Fw propagate](/images/propagate_fw.png)) creates a
    copy of the object on `N` _subsequent_ frames at the same position.
  - **Propagate backward** (![Back propagate](/images/propagate_back.png)) creates
    a copy of the object on `N` _previous_ frames at the same position.

- **To background** - moves the object to the background. The keyboard shortcut **-** or **\_**
- **To foreground** - moves the object to the foreground. The keyboard shortcut **+** or **=**
- **Change instance color**- choosing a color using the color picker (available only in instance mode).

- **Remove** - removes the object. The keyboard shortcut **Del**, **Shift+Del**.

A shape can be locked to prevent its modification or moving by an accident. Shortcut to lock an object: **L**.

A shape can be **Occluded**. Shortcut: **Q**. Such shapes have dashed boundaries.

## Labels

In this tab, you can lock or hide objects of a certain label.
To change the color for a specific label,
you need to go to the task page and select the color by clicking the edit button,
this way you will change the label color for all jobs in the task.

**Fast label change**

You can change the label of an object using hotkeys.
In order to do it, you need to assign a number (from 0 to 9) to labels.
By default numbers 1,2...0 are assigned to the first ten labels.
To assign a number, click on the button placed at the right of a label name on the sidebar.

![](/images/image210.jpg)

After that, you will be able to assign a corresponding label to an object
by hovering your mouse cursor over it and pressing **Ctrl** + **Num(0..9)**.

In case you do not point the cursor to the object, pressing **Ctrl** + **Num(0..9)** will set a chosen label as default,
so that the next object you create (use the `N` key) will automatically have this label assigned.
