## Image settings in CVAT

The **Image settings** panel serves
as a versatile tool for fine-tuning the visual aspects of your image.
Whether you need to brighten the image,
increase contrast, or make other adjustments, this panel is your go-to.

Additionally, the panel allows you
to overlay a grid on the image for more precise annotation.

> **Note**: Adjusting the image settings only
> alters how the pictures are displayed.
> The images themselves will remain unmodified and unchanged.

By default, the **Image settings** panel is not visible. To access
it, click on the **Arrow Up** (![Image Grid Icon](/images/image-grid-icon.jpg))
icon located at the bottom of the workspace.

## Adding layers and Z-axis slider

**Z-axis Slider** enables you to add annotation layers while
hiding the layers positioned beyond.

You can also move between layers by moving the slider
to the layer you need.

The slider becomes active when multiple Z-layers are present within a frame.
Click **+** on the slider to add a new layer;
upon pressing it, a new layer is automatically created and activated.

You can also relocate objects between layers using the **+** and **-** keys.
