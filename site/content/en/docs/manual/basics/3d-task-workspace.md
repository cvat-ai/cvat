![Interface diagram with marked areas and buttons](/images/image214_carla_town3.jpg)

If the `related_images` folder contains any images, a `context image` will be available  in the perspective window.
The contextual image could be compared to 3D data and would help to identify the labels of marked objects.

`Perspective` – a main window for work with objects in a 3D task.

Projections - projections are tied to an object so that a cuboid is in the center and looks like a rectangle.
Projections show only the selected object.

- `Top` – a projection of the view from above.
- `Side` – a projection of the left side of the object.
- `Front` - a frontal projection of the object.
