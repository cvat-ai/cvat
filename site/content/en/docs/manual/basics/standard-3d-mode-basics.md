`Standard 3d mode` - Designed to work with 3D data.
The mode is automatically available if you add PCD or Kitty BIN format data when you create a task
({{< ilink "/docs/manual/basics/create-annotation-task" "read more" >}}).

You can adjust the size of the projections, to do so, simply drag the boundary between the projections.
