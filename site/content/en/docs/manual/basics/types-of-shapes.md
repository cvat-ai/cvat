There are several shapes with which you can annotate your images:

- `Rectangle` or `Bounding box`
- `Polygon`
- `Polyline`
- `Points`
- `Ellipse`
- `Cuboid`
- `Cuboid in 3d task`
- `Skeleton`
- `Tag`

And there is what they look like:

`Tag` - has no shape in the workspace, but is displayed in objects sidebar.
