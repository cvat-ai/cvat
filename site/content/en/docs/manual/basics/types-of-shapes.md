There are several shapes with which you can annotate your images:

- `Rectangle` or `Bounding box`
- `Polygon`
- `Polyline`
- `Points`
- `Ellipse`
- `Cuboid`
- `Cuboid in 3d task`
- `Skeleton`
- `Tag`

And there is what they look like:

![Rectangle](/images/image038_detrac.jpg 'Rectangle') ![Polygon](/images/image033_detrac.jpg 'Polygon')

![Polyline](/images/image009_mapillary_vistas.jpg 'Polyline') ![Points](/images/image010_affectnet.jpg 'Points')

![Ellipse](/images/image240_mapillary_vistas.jpg 'Ellipse') ![Cuboid](/images/image015_detrac.jpg 'Cuboid')

![Cuboid in 3d task](/images/image218_carla_town3.jpg 'Cuboid in 3d task') ![Skeleton](/images/image_skeleton_sample.jpg 'Skeleton')

![Tag](/images/image135.jpg 'Tag')

`Tag` - has no shape in the workspace, but is displayed in objects sidebar.
