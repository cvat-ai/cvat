There are several shapes with which you can annotate your images:

- `Rectangle` or `Bounding box`
- `Polygon`
- `Polyline`
- `Points`
- `Ellipse`
- `Cuboid`
- `Cuboid in 3d task`
- `Skeleton`
- `Tag`

And there is what they look like:

![](/images/image038_detrac.jpg 'Rectangle') ![](/images/image033_detrac.jpg 'Polygon')

![](/images/image009_mapillary_vistas.jpg 'Polyline') ![](/images/image010_affectnet.jpg 'Points')

![](/images/image240_mapillary_vistas.jpg 'Ellipse') ![](/images/image015_detrac.jpg 'Cuboid')

![](/images/image218_carla_town3.jpg 'Cuboid in 3d task') ![](/images/image_skeleton_sample.jpg 'Skeleton')

![](/images/image135.jpg 'Tag')

`Tag` - has no shape in the workspace, but is displayed in objects sidebar.
