---

In CVAT, it's possible to evaluate the quality of annotation through
the creation of a **Ground truth** job, referred to as a Honeypot.
To estimate the task quality, CVAT compares all other jobs in the task against the
established **Ground truth** job, and calculates annotation quality
based on this comparison.

> **Note** that quality estimation only supports
> 2d tasks. It supports all the annotation types except 2d cuboids.

> **Note** that tracks are considered separate shapes
> and compared on a per-frame basis with other tracks and shapes.

## Ground truth job

A **Ground truth** job is a way to tell CVAT where to store
and get the "correct" annotations for task quality estimation.

To estimate task quality, you need to
create a **Ground truth** job in the task,
and annotate it. You donâ€™t need to
annotate the whole dataset twice,
the annotation quality of a small part of
the data shows the quality of annotation for
the whole dataset.

For the quality assurance to function correctly, the **Ground truth** job must
have a small portion of the task frames and the frames must be chosen randomly.
Depending on the dataset size and task complexity,
**5-15% of the data is typically good enough** for quality estimation,
while keeping extra annotation overhead acceptable.

For example, in a typical **task with 2000 frames**, selecting **just 5%**,
which is 100 extra frames to annotate, **is enough** to estimate the
annotation quality. If the task contains **only 30 frames**, it's advisable to
select **8-10 frames**, which is **about 30%**.

It is more than 15% but in the case of smaller datasets,
we need more samples to estimate quality reliably.

To create a **Ground truth** job, do the following:

1. Create a {{< ilink "/docs/manual/basics/create_an_annotation_task" "task" >}}, and open the task page.
2. Click **+**.

   ![Create job](/images/honeypot01.jpg)

3. In the **Add new job** window, fill in the following fields:

   ![Add new job](/images/honeypot02.jpg)

   - **Job type**: Use the default parameter **Ground truth**.
   - **Frame selection method**: Use the default parameter **Random**.
   - **Quantity %**: Set the desired percentage of frames for the **Ground truth** job.
     <br>**Note** that when you use **Quantity %**, the **Frames** field will be autofilled.
   - **Frame count**: Set the desired number of frames for the "ground truth" job.
     <br>**Note** that when you use **Frames**, the **Quantity %** field will be will be autofilled.
   - **Seed**: (Optional) If you need to make the random selection reproducible, specify this number.
     It can be any integer number, the same value will yield the same random selection (given that the
     frame number is unchanged). <br> **Note** that if you want to use a
     custom frame sequence, you can do this using the server API instead,
     see [Jobs API #create](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/api_sdk/sdk/reference/apis/jobs-api/#create).

4. Click **Submit**.
5. Annotate frames, save your work.
6. Change the status of the job to **Completed**.
7. Change **Stage** to **Accepted**.

The **Ground truth** job will appear in the jobs list.

## Managing Ground Truth jobs: Import, Export, and Deletion

Annotations from **Ground truth** jobs are not included in the dataset export,
they also cannot be imported during task annotations import
or with automatic annotation for the task.

Import, export, and delete options are available from the
job's menu.

![Add new job](/images/honeypot04.jpg)

### Import

If you want to import annotations into the **Ground truth** job, do the following.

1. Open the task, and find the **Ground truth** job in the jobs list.
2. Click on three dots to open the menu.
3. From the menu, select **Import annotations**.
4. Select import format, and select file.
5. Click **OK**.

> **Note** that if there are imported annotations for the frames that exist in the task,
> but are not included in the **Ground truth** job, they will be ignored.
> This way, you don't need to worry about "cleaning up" your **Ground truth**
> annotations for the whole dataset before importing them.
> Importing annotations for the frames that are not known in the task still raises errors.

### Export

To export annotations from the **Ground truth** job, do the following.

1. Open the task, and find a job in the jobs list.
2. Click on three dots to open the menu.
3. From the menu, select **Export annotations**.

### Delete

To delete the **Ground truth** job, do the following.

1. Open the task, and find the **Ground truth** job in the jobs list.
2. Click on three dots to open the menu.
3. From the menu, select **Delete**.

## Assessing data quality with Ground truth jobs

Once you've established the **Ground truth** job, proceed to annotate the dataset.

CVAT will begin the quality comparison between the annotated task and the
**Ground truth** job in this task once it is finished (on the `acceptance` stage and in the `completed` state).

> **Note** that the process of quality calculation may take up to several hours, depending on
> the amount of data and labeled objects, and is **not updated immediately** after task updates.

To view results go to the **Task** > **Actions** > **View analytics**> **Performance** tab.

### Quality data

The Analytics page has the following fields:

### Annotation quality settings

If you need to tweak some aspects of comparisons, you can do this from
the **Annotation Quality Settings** menu.

You can configure what overlap
should be considered low or how annotations must be compared.

The updated settings will take effect
on the next quality update.

To open **Annotation Quality Settings**, find
**Quality report** and on the right side of it, click on
three dots.

The following window will open.
Hover over the **?** marks to understand what each field represents.

Annotation quality settings have the following parameters:

### GT conflicts in the CVAT interface

To see GT Conflicts in the CVAT interface, go to **Review** >
**Issues** > **Show ground truth annotations and conflicts**.

![GT conflict](/images/honeypot06.gif)

The ground truth (GT) annotation is depicted as
a dotted-line box with an associated label.

Upon hovering over an issue on the right-side panel with your mouse,
the corresponding GT Annotation gets highlighted.

Use arrows in the Issue toolbar to move between GT conflicts.

To create an issue related to the conflict,
right-click on the bounding box and from the
menu select the type of issue you want to create.
