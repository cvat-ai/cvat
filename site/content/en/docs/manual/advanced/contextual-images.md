Contextual images (or related images) are additional images that provide
context or additional information related to the primary image.

Use them to add extra contextual about the object to improve the accuracy of annotation.

Contextual images are available for 2D and 3D tasks.

See:

- [Folder structure](#folder-structure)
- [Contextual images](#contextual-images)

## Folder structure

To add contextual images to the task, you need to organize the images folder into one of
the supported file layouts. A task with contextual images can be created both from an archive
or from raw files.

Example for 2D tasks:

1. In the folder with the images for annotation, create a folder: `related_images`.
2. Add to the `related_images` a subfolder with the same name
   as the primary image to which it should be linked.
3. Place the contextual image(s) within the subfolder created in step 2.
4. Add folder to the archive.
5. {{< ilink "/docs/manual/basics/create-annotation-task#create-a-task" "Create task" >}}.

Supported file layouts for 2D and 3D tasks:

{{< tabpane text=true >}}
{{% tab header="2D task" %}}

```

  image_2_to_be_annotated.jpg

            context_image_for_image_3.jpg
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab header="3D option 1" %}}

Point clouds and related images are put into the same directory. Related files must have the same
names as the corresponding point clouds. This format is limited by only 1 related image
per point cloud.

```
root_directory/
  pointcloud1.pcd
  pointcloud1.jpg
  pointcloud2.pcd
  pointcloud2.png
  ...
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab header="3D option 2" %}}

Each point cloud is put into a separate directory with matching file name. Related images
are put next to the corresponding point cloud, the file names and extensions can be arbitrary.

```
root_directory/
  pointcloud1/
    pointcloud1.pcd
    pointcloud1_ri1.png
    pointcloud1_ri2.jpg
    ...
  pointcloud2/
    pointcloud2.pcd
    pointcloud2_ri1.bmp
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab header="3D task KITTI format" %}}

Context images are placed in the `image_00/`, `image_01/`, `image_N/` (`N` is any number)
directories. Their file names must correspond to the point cloud files in the `data/` directory.

## Contextual images

The maximum amount of contextual images is twelve.

By default they will be positioned on the right side of the main image.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
By default, only three contextual images will be visible.

When you add contextual images to the set,
small toolbar will appear on the top of the screen, with the following elements:
