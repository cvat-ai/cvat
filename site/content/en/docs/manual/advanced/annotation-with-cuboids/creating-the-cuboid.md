### Drawing cuboid by 4 points

Choose a drawing method `by 4 points` and select `Shape` to enter the drawing mode.
There are many ways to draw a cuboid.
You can draw the cuboid by placing 4 points, after that the drawing will be completed automatically.
The first 3 points determine the plane of the cuboid while the last point determines the depth of that plane.
For the first 3 points, it is recommended to only draw the 2 closest side faces, as well as the top and bottom face.

A few examples:

### Drawing cuboid from rectangle

Choose a drawing method `from rectangle` and select `Shape` to enter the drawing mode.
When you draw using the rectangle method, you must select the frontal plane of the object using the bounding box.
The depth and perspective of the resulting cuboid can be edited.
