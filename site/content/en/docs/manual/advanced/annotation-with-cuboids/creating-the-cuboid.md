#### Drawing cuboid by 4 points

Choose a drawing method “by 4 points” and click Shape to enter the drawing mode. There are many ways to draw a cuboid.
You can draw the cuboid by placing 4 points, after that the drawing will be completed automatically.
The first 3 points determine the plane of the cuboid while the last point determines the depth of that plane.
For the first 3 points, it is recommended to only draw the 2 closest side faces, as well as the top and bottom face.

The depth and perspective of the resulting cuboid can be edited.
