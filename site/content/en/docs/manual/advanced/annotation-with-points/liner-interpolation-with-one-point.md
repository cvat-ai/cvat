You can use linear interpolation for points to annotate a moving object:

1. Before you start, select the `Points`.
1. Linear interpolation works only with one point, so you need to set `Number of points` to 1.
1. After that select the `Track`.

1. Click `Track` to enter the drawing mode left-click to create a point
   and after that shape will be automatically completed.

1. Move forward a few frames and move the point to the desired position,
   this way you will create a keyframe and intermediate frames will be drawn automatically.
   You can work with this object as with an interpolated track: you can hide it using the `Outside`,
   move around keyframes, etc.

1. This way you'll get linear interpolation using the `Points`.
