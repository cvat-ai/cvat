It is used for face, landmarks annotation etc.

Before you start you need to select the `Points`. If necessary you can set a fixed number of points
in the `Number of points` field, then drawing will be stopped automatically.

Click `Shape` to entering the drawing mode. Now you can start annotation of the necessary area.
Points are automatically grouped â€” all points will be considered linked between each start and finish.
Press `N` again or click the `Done` button on the top panel to finish marking the area.
You can delete a point by clicking with pressed `Ctrl` or right-clicking on a point and selecting `Delete point`.
Clicking with pressed `Shift` will open the points shape editor.
There you can add new points into an existing shape. You can zoom in/out (when scrolling the mouse wheel)
and move (when clicking the mouse wheel and moving the mouse) while drawing. You can drag an object after
it has been drawn and change the position of individual points after finishing an object.
