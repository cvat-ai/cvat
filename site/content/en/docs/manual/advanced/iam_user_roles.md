CVAT offers two distinct types of roles:

- **Global Roles**: These are universal roles that apply to the entire system. Anyone who logs into the CVAT.ai
  platform is automatically assigned a global role. It sets the basic permissions that every registered user
  has across CVAT.ai, regardless of their specific tasks or responsibilities.
- **Organization Roles**: These roles determine what a user can do within the Organization,
  allowing for more tailored access based on the user’s specific duties and responsibilities.

Organization roles complement global roles by determining the
visibility of different resources for example, tasks or jobs.

**Limits**: Limits are applicable to all users of the CVAT.ai Cloud Platform
using the [**Free plan**](https://www.cvat.ai/pricing/cloud) and can be lifted upon
{{< ilink "/docs/enterprise/subscription-managment" "**choosing a subscription**" >}}.

All roles are predefined and cannot be modified through the user interface.
However, within the _self-hosted solution_, roles can be adjusted using `.rego`
files stored in `cvat/apps/*/rules/`.
Rego is a declarative language employed for defining
OPA (Open Policy Agent) policies, and its syntax is detailed
in the [**OPA documentation**](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/).

> Note: Once you've made changes to the `.rego` files, you must
> rebuild and restart the Docker Compose for those changes to be applied.
> In this scenario, be sure to include the `docker-compose.dev.yml` compose
> configuration file when executing the Docker Compose command.

| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Administrator**           | An administrator possesses unrestricted access to the CVAT instance and all activities within this instance. The administrator has visibility over all tasks and projects, with the ability to modify or manage each comprehensively. This role is exclusive to self-hosted instances, ensuring comprehensive oversight and control.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **User <br>(default role)** | A User is a default role who is assigned to any user who is registered in CVAT*. Users can view and manage all tasks and projects within their registered accounts, but their activities are subject to specific limitations, see Free plan. <br><br>* If a user, that did not have a CVAT account, has been invited to the organization by the organization owner or maintainer, it will be automatically assigned the Organization role and will be subject to the role's limitations when operating within the Organization. |
| **Worker**                  | Workers are limited to specific functionalities and do not have the permissions to create tasks, assign roles, or perform other administrative actions. Their activities are primarily focused on viewing and interacting with the content within the boundaries of their designated roles (validation or annotation of the jobs).                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Job Stage

Job **Stage** can be assigned to any team member.

**Stages** are not roles.

Jobs can have an assigned user (with any role) and that **Assignee**
will perform a **Stage** specific work which is to annotate,
validate, or accept the job.

![Job stage](/images/job-stage.png)

Job **Stage** can be:

<!--lint disable maximum-line-length-->

| Stage          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Annotation** | Provides access to annotation tools. Assignees will be able to see their assigned jobs and annotate them. By default, assignees with the **Annotation** stage cannot report annotation errors or issues.             |
| **Validation** | Grants access to QA tools. Assignees will see their assigned jobs and can validate them while also reporting issues. By default, assignees with the **Validation** stage cannot correct errors or annotate datasets. |
| **Acceptance** | Does not grant any additional access or change the annotator’s interface. It just marks the job as done.                                                                                                             |

<!--lint enable maximum-line-length-->

Any **Assignee** can modify their assigned **Stage** specific
functions via the annotation interface toolbar:

![Job stage change](/images/change-stage.png)

- **Standard**: switches interface to **Annotation** mode.
- **Review**: switches interface to the **Validation** mode.
