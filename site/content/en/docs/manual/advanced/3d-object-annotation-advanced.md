As well as 2D-task objects, 3D-task objects support the ability to change appearance, attributes,
properties and have an action menu. Read more in
{{< ilink "/docs/manual/basics/objects-sidebar" "objects sidebar" >}} section.

## Moving an object

If you hover the cursor over a cuboid and press `Shift+N`, the cuboid will be cut,
so you can paste it in other place (double-click to paste the cuboid).

## Copying

As well as in 2D task you can copy and paste objects by `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V`,
but unlike 2D tasks you have to place a copied object in a 3D space (double click to paste).

## Image of the projection window

You can copy or save the projection-window image by left-clicking on it and selecting a "save image as" or "copy image".
