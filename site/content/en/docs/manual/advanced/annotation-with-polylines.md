It is used for road markup annotation etc.

Before starting, you need to select the `Polyline`. You can set a fixed number of points
in the `Number of points` field, then drawing will be stopped automatically.

Click `Shape` to enter drawing mode. There are two ways to draw a polyline â€”
you either create points by clicking or by dragging a mouse on the screen while holding `Shift`.
When `Shift` isn't pressed, you can zoom in/out (when scrolling the mouse wheel)
and move (when clicking the mouse wheel and moving the mouse), you can delete
previous points by right-clicking on it.
Press `N` again or click the `Done` button on the top panel to complete the shape.
You can delete a point by clicking on it with pressed `Ctrl` or right-clicking on a point
and selecting `Delete point`. Click with pressed `Shift` will open a polyline editor.
There you can create new points(by clicking or dragging) or delete part of a polygon closing
the red line on another point. Press `Esc` to cancel editing.
