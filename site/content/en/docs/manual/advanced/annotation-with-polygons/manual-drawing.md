- When `Shift` isn't pressed, you can zoom in/out (when scrolling the mouse
  wheel) and move (when clicking the mouse wheel and moving the mouse), you can also
  delete the previous point by right-clicking on it.
- You can use the `Selected opacity` slider in the `Objects sidebar` to change the opacity of the polygon.
  You can read more in the {{< ilink "/docs/manual/basics/objects-sidebar#appearance" "Objects sidebar" >}} section.
- Press `N` again or click the `Done` button on the top panel for completing the shape.
- After creating the polygon, you can move the points or delete them by right-clicking and selecting `Delete point`
  or clicking with pressed `Alt` key in the context menu.
