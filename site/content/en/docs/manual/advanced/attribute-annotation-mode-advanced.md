Basic operations in the mode were described in section [attribute annotation mode (basics)](/docs/manual/basics/attribute-annotation-mode-basics/).

It is possible to handle lots of objects on the same frame in the mode.

It is more convenient to annotate objects of the same type. In this case you can apply
the appropriate filter. For example, the following filter will
hide all objects except person: `label=="Person"`.

To navigate between objects (person in this case),
use the following buttons `switch between objects in the frame` on the special panel:

or shortcuts:

- `Tab` — go to the next object
- `Shift+Tab` — go to the previous object.

In order to change the zoom level, go to settings (press `F3`)
in the workspace tab and set the value Attribute annotation mode (AAM) zoom margin in px.
