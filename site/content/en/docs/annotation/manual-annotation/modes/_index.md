description: 'Overview of editor-level modes in CVAT and how they affect the annotation workflow.'
---

CVAT provides several editor-level modes that change how the annotation workspace behaves.
These modes control what actions are available to the user, which tools can be used, and how objects can be
created or modified.

Use this section to understand when to switch modes and how each mode supports a specific step of the annotation workflow.
