There are several shapes with which you can annotate your images:

- `Rectangle` or `Bounding box`
- `Polygon`
- `Polyline`
- `Points`
- `Ellipse`
- `Cuboid`
- `Cuboid in 3D task`
- `Skeleton`
- `Tag`

And there is what they look like:

![Example of an annotation with "Polyline" shape](/images/image009_mapillary_vistas.jpg 'Polyline') ![Example of an annotation with "Points" shape](/images/image010_affectnet.jpg 'Points')

![Example of an annotation with "Ellipse" shape](/images/image240_mapillary_vistas.jpg 'Ellipse') ![Example of an annotation with "Cuboid" shape](/images/image015_detrac.jpg 'Cuboid')

![Example of a cuboid in 3D task](/images/image218_carla_town3.jpg 'Cuboid in 3D task') ![Example of an annotation with "Skeleton" shape](/images/image_skeleton_sample.jpg 'Skeleton')

![Example of a tag in interface](/images/image135.jpg 'Tag')

`Tag` - has no shape in the workspace, but is displayed in objects sidebar.
