### Added

- Added selective display feature for object details in workspace settings
  - Users can now enable selective display to show details only for specific labels and attributes
  - Added UI controls in workspace settings to select which labels and attributes to display
  - Selective display works independently of "Always show object details" setting
  - Both canvas text and sidebar object details respect selective display settings
  - Settings changes are applied immediately without requiring workspace reload
