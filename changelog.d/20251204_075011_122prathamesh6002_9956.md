### Added

- Add a "Filter frames only" option in annotation filters. When enabled, the filter
  will be used to navigate between frames (jump to frames that match the filter),
  but the UI will display all annotations on the landed frame (not only the
  annotations matching the filter). This is useful when reviewing frames that
  contain specific objects while still seeing full context on each frame
