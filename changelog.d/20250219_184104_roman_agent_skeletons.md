### Added

- \[SDK\] Auto-annotation functions that output skeletons can now be used
  via agents
  (<https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/pull/9122>)

### Changed

- \[SDK\] `DetectionFunctionSpec` now requires that the type of keypoint
  sublabels is set to `points`. Accordingly, `keypoint_spec` now sets
  this type by default
  (<https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/pull/9122>)
