### Changed

- - **Improved object layer movement (`zOrder`) logic:**
  - Previously, `zOrder` was set directly to `minZLayer - 1` and `maxZLayer + 1`, potentially causing out-of-bounds values.
  - Now, `zOrder` is updated incrementally while ensuring it remains within `minZLayer` and `maxZLayer`.
  - This prevents unintended jumps and improves annotation precision.
- **Updated UI labels** for clarity:
  - "To background" → "Move to previous layer"
  - "To foreground" → "Move to next layer"
- **Refactored redundant function calls**:
  - Eliminated unnecessary reassignments of `zOrder` before applying constraints.
