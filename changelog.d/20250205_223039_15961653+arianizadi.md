### Changed

- - **Added function for moving a layer by one `zOrder`:**
  - Introduced a new function to move a layer forward or backward by one `zOrder` while ensuring it remains within `minZLayer` and `maxZLayer`.
  - This function prevents out-of-bounds values and improves annotation precision.
- **Added new UI labels and keybindings** for enhanced navigation:
  - "Move to previous layer" (keybind: 'u')
  - "Move to next layer" (keybind: 'j')
