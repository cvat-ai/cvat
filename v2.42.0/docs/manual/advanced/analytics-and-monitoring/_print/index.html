    <div class="lead">Guidelines for assessing annotation quality in CVAT automatically</div>
	<p>In CVAT, it&rsquo;s possible to evaluate the quality of annotation through the creation
of a validation subset of images. To estimate the task quality, CVAT compares
all other jobs in the task against the established <strong>Ground truth</strong> job,
and calculates annotation quality based on this comparison.</p>


<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
<h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4>

    Quality estimation only supports
2d tasks. It supports all the annotation types except 2d cuboids.

</div>



<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
<h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4>

    Quality estimation is available for projects, tasks, and jobs.

</div>

<p>CVAT has the following features for automated quality control of annotations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validation set configuration for a task</li>
<li>Job validation on job finish (&ldquo;<a href="/v2.42.0/docs/enterprise/immediate-feedback/">Immediate feedback</a>&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Review mode for problems found</li>
<li>Quality analytics</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>There are several approaches to quality estimation used in the industry. In CVAT,
we can use a method known as Ground Truth or Honeypots. The method assumes there are
Ground Truth annotations for images in the dataset. This method is statistical,
which means that we can use only a small portion of the whole dataset to
estimate quality on the full dataset, so we don&rsquo;t need to annotate the whole dataset twice.
Here we assume that the images in the dataset are similar (represent the same task).</p>
<p>We will call the validation portion of the whole dataset (or a task in CVAT) a validation set.
In practice, it is typically expected that annotations in the validation set are carefully
validated and curated. It means that they are more expensive - creating them might require
expert annotators or just several iterations of annotation and validation. It means that it&rsquo;s
desirable to keep the validation set small enough. At the same time, it must be representative
enough to provide reliable estimations. To achieve this, it&rsquo;s advised that the validation set
images are sampled randomly and independently from the full dataset.
That is, for the quality assurance to function correctly, the validation set must
have some portion of the task frames, and the frames must be chosen randomly.</p>
<p>Depending on the dataset size, data variance, and task complexity,
<strong>5-15% of the data is typically good enough</strong> for quality estimation,
while keeping extra annotation overhead for the Ground Truth acceptable.</p>
<p>For example, in a typical <strong>task with 2000 frames</strong>, selecting <strong>just 5%</strong>,
which is 100 extra frames to annotate, <strong>is enough</strong> to estimate the
annotation quality. If the task contains <strong>only 30 frames</strong>, it&rsquo;s advisable to
select <strong>8-10 frames</strong>, which is <strong>about 30%</strong>. It is more than 15%,
but in the case of smaller datasets, we need more samples to estimate quality reliably,
as data variance is higher.</p>
<h2 id="ground-truth-jobs">Ground truth jobs</h2>
<p>A <strong>Ground Truth job</strong> (GT job) is a way to represent the validation set in a CVAT task.
This job is similar to regular annotation jobs - you can edit the annotations manually,
use auto-annotation features, and import annotations in this job. There can be no more
than 1 Ground Truth job in a task.</p>
<p>To enable quality estimation in a task, you need to create a Ground truth job in the task,
annotate it, switch the job stage to <code>acceptance</code>, and set the job state to <code>completed</code>.
Once the Ground Truth job is configured, CVAT will start using this job for quality estimation.</p>
<p>Read more about Ground Truth management <a href="#ground-truth-job-management">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-quality-estimation">Configuring quality estimation</h2>
<p>There are 2 key components related to quality estimation configuration:
Ground Truth jobs and Quality settings. Ground Truth jobs are configured at the Task level.
In this section, we explain how to set up a Ground Truth job.
Read more about quality settings <a href="#annotation-quality-settings">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>Ground truth</strong> job is considered <strong>configured</strong>
if it is at the <strong>acceptance</strong> stage and in the <strong>completed</strong> state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <em>configured</em> Ground Truth job is required for all quality computations in CVAT.</p>

<h2 id="validation-modes">Validation modes</h2>
<p>Currently, there are 2 validation modes available for tasks: <strong>Ground Truth</strong> and <strong>Honeypots</strong>.
These names are often used interchangeably, but in CVAT they have some differences.
Both modes rely on the use of Ground Truth annotations in a task,
stored in a <a href="#ground-truth-jobs">Ground Truth job</a>, where they can be managed.</p>
<h3 id="ground-truth">Ground Truth</h3>
<p>In this mode some of the task frames are selected into the validation set, represented as a
separate Ground Truth job. The regular annotation jobs in the task are not affected in any way.</p>
<p>Ground Truth jobs can be created at the task creation automatically or
manually at any moment later. They can also be removed manually at any moment.
This validation mode is available for any tasks and annotations.</p>
<p>This is a flexible mode that can be enabled or disabled at any moment without any disruptions
to the annotation process.</p>
<h4 id="frame-selection">Frame selection</h4>
<p>This validation mode can use several frame selection methods.</p>
<h5 id="random">Random</h5>
<p>This is a simple method that selects frames into the validation set randomly,
representing the <a href="#basics">basic approach</a>, described above.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>frame count - the number or percent of the task frames to be used for validation.
Can be specified as an absolute number in the <code>Frame count</code> field or a percent in the <code>Quantity</code>
field. If there are both fields on the page, they are linked, which means changing one of them
will adjust the other one automatically.</li>
<li>random seed - a number to be used to initialize the random number generator. Can be useful if
you want to create a reproducible sequence of frames.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="random-per-job">Random per job</h5>
<p>This method selects frames into the validation set randomly from each annotation job in the task.</p>
<p>It solves one of the issues with the simple Random method that some of the jobs can get
no validation frames, which makes it impossible to estimate quality in such jobs. Note
that using this method can result in increased total size of the validation set.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>frame count per job - the percent of the job frames to be used for validation.
This method uses segment size of the task to select the same number of validation frames
in each job, if possible. Can be specified as an absolute number in the <code>Frame count</code>
field or a percent in the <code>Quantity per job</code> field. If there are both fields on the page,
they are linked, which means changing one of them will adjust the other one automatically.</li>
<li>random seed - a number to be used to initialize the random number generator. Can be useful if
you want to create a reproducible sequence of frames.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="honeypots">Honeypots</h3>
<p>In this mode some random frames of the task are selected into the validation set.
Then, validation frames are randomly mixed into regular annotation jobs.
This mode can also be called &ldquo;Ground Truth pool&rdquo;, reflecting the way validation frames are used.
This mode can only be used at task creation and cannot be changed later.</p>
<p>The mode has some limitations on the compatible tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not possible to use it for an already existing task, the task has to be recreated.</li>
<li>This mode assumes random frame ordering, so it is only available for image annotation tasks
and not for ordered sequences like videos.</li>
<li>Tracks are not supported in such tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The validation set can be managed after the task is created - annotations can be edited,
frames can be excluded and restored, and honeypot frames in the regular jobs can be changed.
However, it&rsquo;s not possible to select new validation frames after the task is created.
The Ground truth job created for this validation mode cannot be deleted.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>frame count per job (%) - the percent of job frames (segment size) to be <strong>added</strong> into each
annotation job from the validation set. Can be specified in the <code>Overhead per job</code> field.</li>
<li>total frame count (%) - the percent of the task frames to be included into the validation set.
This value must result in at least <code>frame count per job</code> * <code>segment size</code> frames. Can be specified
in the <code>Total honeypots</code> field.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mode-summary">Mode summary</h3>
<p>Here is a brief comparison of the validation modes:</p>

</table>
<h3 id="choosing-the-right-mode">Choosing the right mode</h3>
<p>Here are some examples on how to choose between these options. The general advice is to use
Ground Truth for better flexibility, but keep in mind that it can require more resources for
validation set annotation. Honeypots, on the other hand, can be beneficial if you want to
minimize the number of validation images required, but the downside here is that there are some
limitations on where this mode can be used.</p>
<p>Example: a video annotation with tracks. In this case there is only 1 option -
the Ground Truth mode, so just use it.</p>
<p>Example: an image dataset annotation, image order is not important. Here you can use both options.
You can choose Ground Truth for better flexibility in validation. This way, you will have the
full control of validation frames in the task, annotation options won&rsquo;t be limited, and the
regular jobs will not be affected in any way. However, if you have a limited budget
for the validation (for instance, you have only a small number of validation frames) or you want
to allow more scalability (with this approach the number of validation frames doesn&rsquo;t depend on
the number of regular annotation jobs), it makes sense to consider using Honeypots instead.</p>
<h2 id="quality-management">Quality management</h2>
<p>If a task has a validation configured, there are several options to manage validation set images.
With any of the validation modes, there will be a special Ground Truth (GT) job in the task.</p>
<h3 id="validation-set-management">Validation set management</h3>
<p>Validation frames can be managed on the task Quality Management page. Here it&rsquo;s possible to
check the number of validation frames, current validation mode and review the frame details.
For each frame you can see the number of uses in the task. When in the Ground Truth mode, this
number will be 1 for all frames. With Honeypots, these numbers can be 0, 1 or more.</p>
<h4 id="frame-changes">Frame changes</h4>
<p>In both validation modes it&rsquo;s possible to exclude some of the validation frames
from being used for validation. This can be useful if you find that some
of the validation frames are &ldquo;bad&rdquo;, extra, or if they have incorrect annotations,
which you don&rsquo;t want to fix. Once a frame is marked &ldquo;excluded&rdquo;, it will not be used
for validation. There is also an option to restore a previously excluded frame if you decide so.</p>
<p>There is an option to exclude or restore frames in bulk mode. To use it, select the frames needed
using checkboxes, and click one of the buttons next to the table header.</p>
<h4 id="ground-truth-job-management">Ground Truth job management</h4>
<p>In the Ground Truth validation mode, there will be an option to remove the <a href="#ground-truth-jobs">Ground Truth job</a>
from the task. It can be useful if you want to change validation set frames completely,
add more frames, or remove some of the frames for any reason. This is available in the job
Actions menu.</p>
<p>In the Honeypots mode, it&rsquo;s not possible to add or remove the GT job, so it&rsquo;s not possible to
add more validation frames.</p>
<p><img src="/images/honeypot04.jpg" alt="Ground truth job actions"></p>
<h3 id="create">Create</h3>
<p>A Ground Truth job can be <a href="#configuring-quality-estimation">added manually</a>
in a task without a selected validation mode or in a task with the Ground Truth validation mode,
after the existing Ground Truth job is <a href="#delete">deleted manually</a>.</p>
<h3 id="delete">Delete</h3>
<p>To delete the Ground Truth job, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the task and find the Ground Truth job in the jobs list.</li>
<li>Click on three dots to open the menu.</li>
<li>From the menu, select <strong>Delete</strong>.</li>
</ol>


<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
<h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4>

    The Ground truth job in the &ldquo;Honeypots&rdquo; task validation mode cannot be deleted.

</div>

<h3 id="import-annotations">Import annotations</h3>
<p>If you want to import annotations into the Ground truth job, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the task and find the Ground truth job in the jobs list.</li>
<li>Click on three dots to open the menu.</li>
<li>From the menu, select <strong>Import annotations</strong>.</li>
<li>Select import format and select file.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>


<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
<h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4>

    If there are imported annotations for the frames that exist in the task,
but are not included in the <strong>Ground truth</strong> job, they will be ignored.
This way, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about &ldquo;cleaning up&rdquo; your Ground truth
annotations for the whole dataset before importing them.
Importing annotations for the frames that are not known in the task still raises errors.

</div>

<h3 id="export-annotations">Export annotations</h3>
<p>To export annotations from the Ground Truth job, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the task and find a job in the jobs list.</li>
<li>Click on three dots to open the menu.</li>
<li>From the menu, select <strong>Export annotations</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="annotation-management">Annotation management</h3>
<p>Annotations for validation frames can be displayed and edited in a special
<a href="#ground-truth-jobs">Ground Truth job</a> in the task. You can edit the annotations manually,
use auto-annotation features, import and export annotations in this job.</p>
<p>In the Ground Truth task validation mode, annotations of the ground Truth job do not affect
other jobs in any way. The Ground Truth job is just a separate job, which can only be
changed directly. Annotations from <strong>Ground truth</strong> jobs are not included in the dataset
export, they also cannot be imported during task annotations import
or with automatic annotation for the task.</p>
<p>In the Honeypots task validation mode, the annotations of the GT job also do not affect other
jobs in any way. However, import and export of <strong>task</strong> annotations works differently.
When importing <strong>task</strong> annotations, annotations for validation frames will be copied
both into GT job frames and into corresponding honeypot frames in annotation jobs.
When exporting <strong>task</strong> annotations, honeypot frames in annotation jobs will be ignored,
and validation frames in the resulting dataset will get annotations from the GT job.</p>


<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
<h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4>

    That it means that exporting from a task with honeypots and importing the results back
will result in changed annotations on the honeypot frames. If you want to backup annotations,
use a task backup or export job annotations instead.

</div>

<p>Import and export of Ground Truth <strong>job</strong> annotations works the same way in both modes.</p>
<p>Ground Truth jobs are included in task backups, so can be saved and restored this way.</p>
<p>Import, Export, and Delete options are available from the Ground Truth job Actions menu.

<h3 id="annotation-quality-settings">Annotation quality settings</h3>
<p>Quality settings provide options to tweak some aspects of annotation comparisons and
quality estimation in general. For instance, you can configure which annotation overlap
should be considered good enough or how specific annotation types must be compared.</p>
<p>Quality settings can be set up at the Task or the Project level.
If a task is not bound to a project, it uses its own quality settings.
Tasks inside a project can use individual quality settings or inherit settings
from the project they belong to. Read more about quality settings in projects
<a href="#project-quality-settings">here</a>.</p>
<p>To set up quality settings, open the <strong>Quality Settings</strong> tab on the <strong>Quality Control</strong> page
for a task or project, available in the <strong>Actions</strong> menu.</p>
<p><img src="/images/quality-control-actions-button.png" alt="Quality control button in the task actions menu"></p>
<p>There is a number of parameters available for configuration.
Hover the mouse over a <strong>?</strong> mark to display a description for a setting.</p>
<p><img src="/images/quality-settings-overview.png" alt="Quality settings page"></p>
<p>After the settings are updated, remember to save the values using the <strong>Save</strong> button.
The updated settings will take effect on the next quality update.</p>
<p>Annotation quality settings have the following parameters:</p>

<h3 id="project-quality-settings">Project quality settings</h3>
<p>In CVAT, it is possible to group tasks into projects to share common configurations or establish
a logical grouping for datasets. In this section, we explain options for quality management
inside projects.</p>
<p>When tasks are inside a project, it can be convenient to reuse the same quality setup for
all the project tasks. There is an option to use quality settings from the parent project
for all or only for specific tasks inside a project. This is controlled by the corresponding
toggle on the <strong>Quality control</strong> page of the task:</p>
<p><img src="/images/quality-settings-inherit.png" alt="Task quality settings - inherit project settings"></p>
<p>If some of the project tasks have individual settings, a notification is displayed
on the project settings page. You can enforce project settings for all the project tasks
by clicking the <strong>Force project settings</strong> button.</p>
<p><img src="/images/quality-settings-force-project-settings-button.png" alt="Force projects settings button"></p>
<p>By default, new tasks inside a project inherit the quality settings of the project.
You can freely switch between these 2 modes without losing the individual configuration
for the task.</p>
<p>Updating project quality includes quality computation for all the nested tasks. If the task
quality is updated in a specific task manually, project quality has to be recomputed to display
relevant values.</p>
<h3 id="job-filtering">Job filtering</h3>
<p>Depending on the situation, you may need or don&rsquo;t need to include specific jobs in
the quality report. For example, your workflow may require quality checks only for
completed jobs or maybe you want to exclude jobs from a specific task from
a project quality report. There is an option to filter which jobs are included in quality
computations. You can configure this by changing the <em>Job selection filter</em>
in quality settings. Only jobs matching the filter criteria will be included
in the quality results. If a filter is changed, quality must be recomputed for the filter
to take effect.</p>
<p><img src="/images/quality-settings-job-selection.png" alt="Job selection filter"></p>
<h2 id="comparisons">Comparisons</h2>
<h3 id="tags">Tags</h3>
<p>The equality is used for matching.</p>
<h3 id="shapes">Shapes</h3>
<p>A pair of shapes is considered matching, if both their shapes and labels match.
For each shape, spatial parameters are matched first, then labels are matched.</p>
<p>Each shape type can have their own spatial matching details. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>bounding box - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index">IoU</a> (including rotation).
For example, for a pair of bounding boxes it can be visualized this way:</p>
<p><img src="/images/quality_comparison_bbox1.svg" alt="Bbox IoU"></p>
<p></br><code>IoU = intersection area / union area</code>.</br>
The green part is the intersection, and green, yellow and red ones together are the union.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>polygons, masks - IoU. Polygons and masks are considered interchangeable,
which means a mask can be matched with a polygon and vice versa. Polygons and masks in groups
are merged into a single object first.
If the <a href="#annotation-quality-settings"><em>Match only visible parts</em></a> option is enabled,
objects will be cut to only the visible (non-covered) parts only, which is determined by the
shape z order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>skeletons - The OKS metric <a href="https://cocodataset.org/#keypoints-eval">from the COCO</a>
dataset is used. Briefly, each skeleton point gets a circular area around,
determined by the <em>object size</em> (bounding box side) and <em>relative point size</em> (<em>sigma</em>) values,
where this point can be matched with the specified probability. If a bounding box is grouped
with the skeleton, it is used for object size computation, otherwise a bounding box of
visible points of the skeleton is used.</p>
<p>For example, consider a skeleton with 6 points and a square bounding box attached:</p>
<p><img src="/images/quality_comparison_skeleton1.svg" alt="Skeleton OKS"></p>
<p>In this example, the <em>Sigma</em> parameter is <code>0.05</code> (5%) of the bbox side.
Areas shown in the green color cover ~68.2% (1 sigma) of the points,
corresponding to each GT point. A point on the boundary of such an area will have ~88% of
probability to be correct. The blue-colored zone contains ~95% (2 sigma) of the correct points
for the corresponding GT point. A point on the boundary of such an area will have ~60% of
probability to be correct. These probabilities are then averaged over the visible points of the
skeleton, and the resulting values are compared against the <em>Min similarity threshold</em>
to determine whether the skeletons are matching. <em>Sigma</em> corresponds to one
from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>points - The OKS metric is used for each point group annotation. Same as for skeletons,
<em>OKS Sigma</em> determines relative point sizes. The <em>Point size base</em> setting allows
configuring whether points in point groups should use the group bounding box or the image space.
Using image space for object size can be useful if you want to treat each point
as a separate annotation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>polylines - A pair of lines is considered matching if all the points of one line lie within
a &ldquo;hull&rdquo; of the other one. The &ldquo;hull&rdquo; is determined as the area around the polyline, such as
if the line had some &ldquo;thickness&rdquo;. For example, the black polyline can have a hull shown in
the green color:</p>
<p><img src="/images/quality_comparison_polylines1.png" alt="Polyline thickness and hull"></p>
<p>The line thickness can be configured via the <em>Relative thickness</em> setting.
The value is relative to the image side and determines a half of the hull width.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ellipses - IoU, described in more detail above.</p>
</li>
</ul>

    All metrics are recalculated when you apply the date or table filter.

</div>

<p>The <strong>Events</strong> tab table contains the aggregated events for the selected resource.
Each event is defined by a unique status signature, which is a combination of the
job’s assignee, stage, state, and the user who performed the action.
As long as this status signature stays the same, all events are combined into one row.
For example, if the same user creates two objects in the same job,
the <strong>Events</strong> table will display one event that includes both actions.</p>
<p>However, if the job’s status signature changes (for example, due to an action
performed by a different user) the analytics register a new event. As a result,
actions that might otherwise be aggregated are instead recorded as separate events in the table.</p>
<p>You can filter the events by date range:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the date filter near the page title.</li>
<li>Select the first and last dates or enter them in <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> format.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the date filter is empty, the <strong>Events</strong> tab shows the metrics and events
for the lifetime of the project, task, or job.</p>

<p>CVAT has the following features related to consensus-based annotation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of <strong>consensus replica</strong> jobs for regular annotation jobs in a task</li>
<li>Automatic merging for annotations inside <strong>consensus replica</strong> jobs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>If you want to improve the quality of your annotations, there are several widespread ways
to achieve this. One of the methods is called <em>consensus-based annotation</em> or just <em>consensus</em>.
In this method, the same data is annotated several times. Once there are several different
annotations (&ldquo;opinions&rdquo;) for the same objects, they can be merged in order to obtain
annotations of higher quality.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider an explanatory example. Imagine there is a group of people and
you want to learn whether something is true or not from them.
To accomplish this, you decided to ask everyone and pick the most popular answer in the end.
With such an idea, you can get many possible combinations of votes, including unanimous ones.
This strategy is called <em>majority voting</em> - and it requires such a majority to exist.
If there is an even number of votes for both options,
you don&rsquo;t have enough information to prefer one of the options to the other,
so, in general, it&rsquo;s desirable to have an odd number of people in the group.
With larger groups the method becomes less sensitive to this requirement,
as when the voters are independent and the question is meaningful,
the answers are less likely to separate evenly between the possible options.
This method can also be used if the question has more than 2 possible answers. In this case,
there are more possible distributions of the votes, but the same logic can be applied.</p>
<p>Returning back to datasets, consensus annotation works very similar to the example above.
Each image is annotated several times, typically by different persons, then the resulting
annotations are compared between each other and merged, using majority voting or
a different strategy. The key advantage of consensus annotation is that it helps to reduce
personal annotator bias in annotation. This improves the quality of annotation by filtering out
errors, noise (variance) and outliers in the annotation, leaving only the most representative
ones.</p>
<p>Datasets, typically, have a large number of images and objects. This method of annotation
requires several different annotations for the whole dataset, so it is expected to have
several times of the annotation costs compared to the simple single-annotation approach.
Depending on the annotation resources available, budget, and requirements,
consensus annotation may or may not be feasible in a particular task.</p>
<p>One application for this approach that can be recommended is Ground Truth annotation.
This type of annotation typically requires especially high quality annotations, because
it is used to validate model or annotator answers. Ground Truth is typically limited
only to a small portion of the whole dataset images, for example 3%.
If a 3- or 5-fold <em>consensus</em> is applied to GT annotations, it is possible to obtain
more reliable GT annotations for 10-15% of the full dataset annotation cost.
Once there is such a reliable GT dataset, it can be used for
<a href="/v2.42.0/docs/manual/advanced/analytics-and-monitoring/auto-qa/">annotator validation</a>,
on the remaining dataset ensuring the quality metrics are representative and objective.</p>
<h2 id="consensus-replica-jobs">Consensus replica jobs</h2>
<p>A <strong>Consensus Replica job</strong> (<em>replica</em>) is the way to represent one of
the annotator &ldquo;opinions&rdquo; in CVAT. <em>Consensus replicas</em> work similarly to regular
annotation jobs - they can be assigned, annotated, imported and exported.
When you decide to merge annotations from replicas, the results will be written to the
parent annotation job.</p>
<p>Key properties of consensus replica jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Replicas</em> are connected to annotation jobs. Each annotation job can have
several related <em>replicas</em>.</li>
<li>Only annotation jobs can have replicas. Ground Truth jobs cannot have replicas.</li>
<li>Replicas use the same frame range as their parent annotation jobs.</li>
<li>Annotations in replicas and parent jobs are independent from each other.
Modifying a replica doesn&rsquo;t affect the parent job or other replicas and vice versa.
Removing annotations in a parent job doesn&rsquo;t change annotations in its replicas.</li>
<li>Replicas are not included in <em>task</em> annotation import or export.
<em>Per-job</em> import and export still work for all job types, including replicas.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>When annotating with consensus, the typical workflow looks this way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a task with consensus enabled. Optionally,
<a href="/v2.42.0/docs/manual/basics/create-annotation-task/">configure validation</a></li>
<li>Assign annotators to consensus replicas, wait until all the jobs are completed</li>
<li>Once all replicas in a parent job are completed, merge annotations</li>
<li>Review and resolve problems in the parent jobs</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-to-enable-consensus-in-a-task">How to enable consensus in a task</h3>
<p>Consensus annotation is configured at the Task level. It can only be specified at task creation.
If you want to enable consensus for one of your existing tasks, you&rsquo;ll need to recreate the task.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="/v2.42.0/docs/manual/basics/create-annotation-task/">task creation</a> page</li>
<li>Configure basic and advanced parameters according to your requirements,
and attach a dataset to be annotated.</li>
<li>To enable consensus for the task, open the <strong>Advanced</strong> section and
set <strong>Consensus Replicas</strong> to a value greater than 1.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/images/consensus-replicas-task-parameter.png" alt="Consensus replicas parameter image"></p>
<ol>
<li>Create the task and open the task page</li>
</ol>
<p>If a task has consensus enabled, you&rsquo;ll see the <strong>Consensus</strong> tag in the task summary.
Existing <strong>Consensus replica</strong> jobs will be displayed in the job list under their parent
annotation jobs.</p>
<p><img src="/images/consensus-replicas-list-task.png" alt="Consensus replica jobs in the task job list"></p>
<h3 id="merging">Merging</h3>
<p>For a given parent job with related annotated consensus jobs, merging will
match annotations between the replicas and save merged annotations into the parent job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note that <strong>merging overrides annotations in the parent job</strong>.
This operation cannot be undone. Please make sure that the parent job
is ready for merging and backup annotations if needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are 2 merging options available:</p>
<ul>
<li>merge replicas in all available parent jobs in a task</li>
<li>merge replicas in a specific parent job</li>
</ul>
<p>Merging is only available for a parent job if it is in the <strong>annotation</strong> stage and
it has at least 1 replica not in the <strong>annotation</strong> - <strong>new</strong> stage and state.
For simplicity, this can be read as &ldquo;if there are any annotated replicas in the parent job&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After merging, parent jobs are switched to the <strong>completed</strong> state automatically.
If you prefer merging at the task level, it is recommended to switch merged
parent jobs to the <strong>validation</strong> stage after they are merged to exclude them from
the next merging and avoid losing the reviewed annotations.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-merge-all-replicas-in-a-task">How to merge all replicas in a task</h3>
