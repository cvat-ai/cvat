## What is CVAT Community?

**CVAT Community** is the free, self-hosted open-source edition of [CVAT](https://www.cvat.ai/) — one of
the most widely used data annotation platforms for building high-quality visual datasets for
computer vision and visual AI.
Since 2018, CVAT has been the go-to annotation platform for millions of users and thousands of AI teams worldwide,
including Fortune 100 companies.

CVAT Community supports image, video, and 3D annotation, dataset management, team collaboration, cloud storage
integration, developer-friendly SDKs and APIs, and gives your team full control over your data
and annotation infrastructure.
The platform serves as the foundation of
[CVAT Online](https://www.cvat.ai/pricing/cvat-online) and
[CVAT Enterprise](https://www.cvat.ai/enterprise), and is actively maintained by the CVAT engineering team.

Why teams choose CVAT Community:

- **Own your data:** Run entirely within your own infrastructure. No data leaves your environment.
- **AI-powered annotation:** Connect your own ML models for detection, segmentation, and tracking to speed up labeling.
- **Team collaboration:** Multi-user and multi-organization support with roles, task assignments,
  and review workflows.
- **MIT licensed:** Free to use in any project, including commercial, with no restrictions.
- **Production-grade:** The foundation of all CVAT commercial products — battle-tested at scale.
- **True open-source:** Transparent development, active community, on GitHub since 2018.

This repository contains the source code and deployment assets for CVAT Community.

For a fully managed setup, annotation services, or enterprise features, see
[CVAT Online](https://www.cvat.ai/pricing/cvat-online),
[CVAT Enterprise](https://www.cvat.ai/enterprise) and
[CVAT Labeling Services](https://www.cvat.ai/annotation-services).

## Getting Started

> 💡 **Tip:** Want to explore CVAT before deploying anything?
> **[Try CVAT Online (Free plan)](https://app.cvat.ai)** directly in your browser.
> Includes SAM 3 segmentation, quality control UI, and built-in analytics
> so you can evaluate the full platform before committing to a self-hosted setup.

### Installation

**Prerequisites:**

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

**1. Start the default stack**

Clone the repository and launch the services.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat
cd cvat

# Optional: set your IP or domain
# export CVAT_HOST=your-ip-or-domain

docker compose up -d
```

**2. Create an admin account**

```bash
docker exec -it cvat_server bash -ic 'python3 ~/manage.py createsuperuser'
```

See the [Installation Guide](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/administration/community/basics/installation/) for full
instructions and OS-specific setup.

**3. Sign in and start labeling**

- Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (or your `CVAT_HOST`) in your browser.
- Log in with your superuser account.
- Create a project or task, upload your data (images, videos, or point clouds), and define labels to start annotating.

Learn more about annotation tools and workflows in the [CVAT Documentation](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/) or
take our free course – [CVAT Academy](https://www.cvat.ai/resources/academy).

_For alternative deployments (AWS, Kubernetes, external PostgreSQL, backups, upgrades), see the [Deployment Guides](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/administration/community/advanced/)._

## Key Capabilities

- **[Manual & Auto-labeling](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/annotation/manual-annotation/):** Annotate images, videos, and
  3D point clouds with bounding boxes, polygons, masks, keypoints, cuboids, tags, and more. Speed up labeling
  by connecting your own models for automatic annotation.
- **[Task Management](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/workspace/):** Organize datasets into projects, split them into tasks
  and jobs, assign work to annotators, and track progress in real time.
- **[Collaboration](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/account_management/user-roles/):** Create organizations, invite teammates,
  assign roles, and collaborate on annotations with comments and issues.
- **[Quality Control](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/qa-analytics/manual-qa/):** Review annotations, flag issues, compare
  results across annotators with consensus, and run Ground Truth and Honeypot checks through the server API.
- **[Analytics](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/administration/community/advanced/analytics/):** Monitor user activity,
  working time by job, events, and server logs with Grafana dashboards.
- **[Data Ops & Integrations](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/dataset_management/export-datasets/):** Export/import in 20+
  formats (COCO, YOLO, Pascal VOC, KITTI, etc.), connect to cloud storage (S3, Azure, Google Cloud), and automate
  via REST API and Python SDK.

Advanced capabilities such as advanced project analytics, quality control UI, built-in auto-labeling with SAM 2
 and SAM 3, AI agents, SSO, and more are available in [CVAT Online](https://www.cvat.ai/pricing/cvat-online)
 paid plans (Solo, Team) and [CVAT Enterprise](https://www.cvat.ai/enterprise).

## Developer Tools

CVAT is designed for automation. Beyond the Web UI, you can integrate it into your pipelines using:

- [Python SDK & CLI](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/api_sdk/sdk/): Automate task creation, data upload, and dataset exports.
- [REST API](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/api_sdk/api/): Full programmatic control over every platform feature.

## Data and Formats

CVAT Community supports image, video, and 3D (point cloud) annotation workflows. You can move data in and out using
over 20+ industry-standard formats: CVAT (XML), COCO (JSON), YOLO (TXT), Ultralytics YOLO (TXT/YAML), Pascal VOC (XML),
KITTI (TXT), MOT (TXT), and more.

[Full list of supported formats.](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/dataset_management/formats/)

## ML and AI Models

CVAT Community supports automatic annotation via pre-built serverless models powered by Nuclio,
covering detection, segmentation, pose estimation, and tracking:

| [Mask RCNN Inception ResNet v2](https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/tree/develop/serverless/openvino/omz/public/mask_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_coco/nuclio) | OpenVINO | Detector |
| [Face Detection 0205](https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/tree/develop/serverless/openvino/omz/intel/face-detection-0205/nuclio) | OpenVINO | Detector |
| [Faster RCNN Inception v2](https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/tree/develop/serverless/tensorflow/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco/nuclio) | TensorFlow | Detector |

To enable automatic annotation, add the serverless component to your deployment:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f components/serverless/docker-compose.serverless.yml up -d
```
