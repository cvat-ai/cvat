    The interface that an auto-annotation detection function must implement.

    A detection function is supposed to accept an image and return a list of shapes
    describing objects in that image.

    Since the same function could be used with multiple datasets, it needs some way
    to refer to labels without using dataset-specific label IDs. The way this is
    accomplished is that the function declares its own labels via the spec attribute,
    and then refers to those labels in the returned annotations. The caller then matches
    up the labels from the function's spec with the labels in the actual dataset, and
    replaces the label IDs in the returned annotations with IDs of the corresponding
    labels in the dataset.

    The matching of labels between the function and the dataset is done by name.
    Therefore, a function can be used with a dataset if they have (at least some) labels
    that have the same name.

        The supplied context will contain information about the current image.

        The returned LabeledShapeRequest objects must follow general constraints
        imposed by the data model (such as the number of points in a shape),
        as well as the following additional constraints:

        * The id attribute must not be set.

        * The source attribute must not be set.

        * The frame_id attribute must be set to 0.

        It's recommented to use the helper factory functions (shape, rectangle, skeleton,
